	abstract = {Two studies examined the effects of {PETTLEP}-based imagery compared to more traditional imagery interventions. {PETTLEP} imagery aims to produce a realistic and more functionally equivalent imagery experience than traditional imagery methods through factors such as wearing the correct clothing or imaging in the correct environment. In Study 1, 48 varsity hockey players were divided into four groups: "Sport-specific" imagery, "clothing" imagery, "traditional" imagery, and control. Imagery participants imaged 10 penalty flicks daily for six weeks, and controls spent an equivalent time reading hockey literature. In the post-test, the sport-specific group scored significantly higher than the clothing group, who scored significantly higher than the traditional imagery group. In Study 2, 40 junior gymnasts attempted a turning jump on the beam. They were split into four groups: A physical practice group, a {PETTLEP} imagery group, a stimulus only imagery group, and a control (stretching) group. Each group performed their task three times per week for six weeks. Both the physical practice and {PETTLEP} groups improved significantly from pre-test to post-test, with no significant difference between them, but the stimulus and control groups did not improve significantly. Taken together the results from Study 1 and 2 provide support for the efficacy of {PETTLEP}-based imagery over more traditional imagery interventions. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine the effects of stretching before and after exercising on muscle soreness after exercise, risk of injury, and athletic performance.
Method: Systematic review.
Data sources: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies identified by searching Medline, Embase, {CINAHL}, {SPORTDiscus}, and {PEDro}, and by recursive checking of bibliographies.
Main outcome measures: Muscle soreness, incidence of injury, athletic performance.
Results: Five studies, all of moderate quality, reported sufficient data on the effects of stretching on muscle soreness to be included in the analysis. Outcomes seemed homogeneous. Stretching produced small and statistically non-significant reductions in muscle soreness. The pooled estimate of reduction in muscle soreness 24 hours after exercising was only 0.9 mm on a 100 mm scale (95\% confidence interval −2.6 mm to 4.4 mm). Data from two studies on army recruits in military training show that muscle stretching before exercising does not produce useful reductions in injury risk (pooled hazard ratio 0.95, 0.78 to 1.16).
Conclusions: Stretching before or after exercising does not confer protection from muscle soreness. Stretching before exercising does not seem to confer a practically useful reduction in the risk of injury, but the generality of this finding needs testing. Insufficient research has been done with which to determine the effects of stretching on sporting performance.},

The participants who were 14-17 age range are licensed players of Amasya Tekhan Sports Club. The protocol employed by Gelen (2008) so as to investigate into the effects of different stretching protocols on the vertical jumping was utilised for tests. Vertical jump tests were conducted on participants three times following each stretching activity in 4-5 min and the best results were noted. Height, body weight and means of {BMI}, standart deviation, minimum and maximum values of the athletes were measured. A one-way variance analysis in repeated measures ({ANOVA}) was employed to analyze the data. Findings clearly indicate that neither static nor dynamic stretching exercises have an effect on jumping performance. Correspondingly, this finding may have caused from the physical and psyhological traits of taekwondo players. In summation, based on the analysis in this study, it can be concluded that static and dynamic stretching exercises done after slow aerobic runnings before jumping had no significant effect on front jumping ({FJ}), squat jumping ({SJ}) and drop jumping ({DJ}) performance.  Article visualizations:},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to compare the acute effect of a static- vs dynamic-based stretching warm-up on standing long jump ({SLJ}) performance in primary schoolchildren. The sample was composed of 76 schoolchildren, 43 girls and 33 boys, aged 9–10 years old from three fourth-grade classes of Primary Education. The three groups were cluster-randomly assigned to the control ({CG}), static ({SG}) or dynamic ({DG}) groups. All the schoolchildren performed a standardized warm-up consisting of mobility exercises (five minutes), jogging (five minutes) and the {SLJ} test. Afterwards the {CG} schoolchildren received jump theory (eight minutes), the {SG} performed static stretching (eight minutes) and the {DG} performed dynamic-bounces stretching (eight minutes). Afterwards, all of them performed the {SLJ} test again. The results of the one-way {ANOVA} (F2,73 = 34.184; p {\textless} 0.001; η2p = 0.484), followed by the pairwise comparisons with the Bonferroni adjustment, showed that the {DG} students ({MΔ} = 11.07, {SE} = 1.42) made a significant statistical improvement in their {SJL} levels compared with the {CG} ({MΔ} = -3.00, {SE} = 1.89; p {\textless} 0.001, d = 1.51) and {SG} students ({MΔ} = -1.85, {SE} = 0.67; p {\textless} 0.001, d = 1.38). However, statistically significant differences between the {CG} and {SG} students were not found (p {\textgreater} 0.05, d = 0.12). The dynamic-bouncing stretch as a final part of a warm-up improves explosive strength performance in primary schoolchildren, and seems to be a good option before carrying out explosive strength activities of the lower body.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Warm-up routines typically include low-intensity aerobic activities, stretching and sport-specific movement patterns rehearsal. Different types of stretching may be included, with static stretching ({SS}) and dynamic stretching being main 2 types, with persistent debate as to the most appropriate type of stretching to perform. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of static and dynamic stretching on vertical jump performance.
{METHODS}: Twenty-three youth basketball players (age, 15.33±0.77 years; height, 182.64±13.18 cm; body mass, 71.01±18.74 kg; training experience, 5.91±1.92 years), participated in this randomized crossover study. After one familiarization session, two test sessions with different warm up protocols were performed in a random order with one week between sessions. Each session consisted of a) 5-minute low-intensity aerobic exercises and b) 8 minutes of static/dynamic stretching, interspersed and immediately followed by countermovement jump testing. The effects of different stretching protocols on countermovement jump height were determined using a 2 (time: pre, post) x 2 (pre-jump protocol: dynamic versus static stretching) repeated analysis of variance.
{RESULTS}: Countermovement jump height was influenced by the interaction of time/ pre-jump stretching protocol (P=0.003), with {SS} significantly decreasing jumping performance (2.36±2.19 cm; P=0.001 {CI}: 1.41-3.30 cm). Dynamic stretching appears to provide non-significant improvements (0.46±1.60 cm; P=0.180; {CI}: 1.15-0.22 cm).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Results suggest that static stretching before practice or competition should be avoided in adolescent basketball players.},

The aim of this study is to investigate acute effects of dynamic and static stretching on horizontal-vertical jump distance of recreational athletes and determine which stretching type should be used in sports requiring high power and anaerobic performance such as jumping by revealing how stretching type affects horizontal-vertical jump performance. 47 males with a mean (±Standard Deviation) age of 20.6 (±1.7) years, a mean height of 178.2 (±5.9) cm, a mean body weight of 72.4 (±9.1) kg, and a mean body mass index of 22.8 (±2.7) kg/m 2 were included in this study. All participants were applied three different programs involving only warm-up (method A), warm-up+ dynamic stretching (method B) and warm-up+ static stretching (method C) after 5 minutes of warm-up run and 2 minutes of active rest. After warm-up and stretching protocols, horizontal and vertical jump tests were performed 3 times and the best values were used for analysis.

The results are presented as mean± standard deviation. p{\textless}0.05 was accepted as the statistical significance level. According to the data obtained in the study, different stretching types did not affect horizontal jump distance (p: 0.44, F: 0.82), whereas a statistically significant difference was found in terms of vertical jump distance after static stretching (p: 0.048, F: 2.86). As a result, we can say that both dynamic and static stretching could be safely used before sport activities requiring high power and static stretching leads to positive results on a statistically significant level.},

	abstract = {Background  The current literature on the chronic effects of static stretching ({SS}) exercises on muscle strength and power is unclear and controversial.
Objective  We aimed to examine the chronic effects of {SS} exercises on muscle strength and power as well as flexibility in healthy individuals across the lifespan. Design  Systematic review with meta-analysis of (randomized) controlled trials. Data Sources  A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases {PubMed}, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and {SPORTDiscus} up to May 2022. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies  We included studies that investigated the chronic effects of {SS} exercises on at least one muscle strength and power outcome compared to an active/passive control group or the contralateral leg (i.e., using between- or within-study designs, respectively) in healthy individuals, irrespective of age, sex, and training status.
Results  The main findings of 41 studies indicated trivial-to-small positive effects of chronic {SS} exercises on muscle strength (standardized mean difference [{SMD}] = 0.21, [95\% confidence interval 0.10–0.32], p = 0.001) and power ({SMD} = 0.19, 95\% confidence interval 0.12–0.26], p {\textless} 0.001). For flexibility, moderate-to-large increases were observed ({SMD} = 0.96, [95\% confidence interval 0.70–1.22], p {\textless} 0.001). Subgroup analyses, taking the participants’ training status into account, revealed a larger muscle strength improvement for sedentary ({SMD} = 0.58, p {\textless} 0.001) compared with recreationally active participants ({SMD} = 0.16, p = 0.029). Additionally, larger flexibility gains were observed following passive ({SMD} = 0.97, p {\textless} 0.001) compared with active {SS} exercises ({SMD} = 0.59, p = 0.001). The chronic effects of {SS} on muscle strength were moderated by the proportion of female individuals in the sample (β = 0.004, p = 0.042), with higher proportions experiencing larger gains. Other moderating variables included mean age (β = 0.011, p {\textless} 0.001), with older individuals showing larger muscle strength gains, and the number of repetitions per stretching exercise and session (β = 0.023, p = 0.004 and β = 0.013, p = 0.008, respectively), with more repetitions associated with larger muscle strength improvements. Muscle power was also moderated by mean age (β = 0.006, p = 0.007) with larger gains in older individuals. The meta-regression analysis indicated larger flexibility gains with more repetitions per session (β = 0.094, p = 0.016), more time under stretching per session (β = 0.090, p = 0.026), and more total time under stretching (β = 0.078, p = 0.034).
Conclusions  The main findings indicated that chronic {SS} exercises have the potential to improve muscle strength and power. Such improvements appear to benefit sedentary more than recreationally active participants. Likewise, chronic {SS} exercises result in a marked enhancement in flexibility with larger effects of passive, as compared with active, {SS}. The results of the meta-regression analysis for muscle strength indicated larger benefits of chronic {SS} exercises in samples with higher proportions of female, older participants, and a higher number of repetitions per stretching exercise and session. For muscle power, results suggested larger gains for older participants. Regarding flexibility, findings indicated larger benefits following a higher number of repetitions per exercise and a longer time under stretching per session as well as a longer total time under stretching.},

	abstract = {There is substantial evidence that static stretching may inhibit performance in strength and power activities. However, most of this research has involved stretching routines dissimilar to those practiced by athletes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the decline in performance normally associated with static stretching pervades when the static stretching is conducted prior to a sport speciﬁc warm-up. Thirteen netball players completed two experimental warm-up conditions. Day 1 warm-up involved a submaximal run followed by 15 min of static stretching and a netball speciﬁc skill warm-up. Day 2 followed the same design; however, the static stretching was replaced with a 15 min dynamic warm-up routine to allow for a direct comparison between the static stretching and dynamic warm-up effects. Participants performed a countermovement vertical jump and 20 m sprint after the ﬁrst warm-up intervention (static or dynamic) and also after the netball speciﬁc skill warm-up. The static stretching condition resulted in signiﬁcantly worse performance than the dynamic warm-up in vertical jump height (−4.2\%, 0.40 {ES}) and 20 m sprint time (1.4\%, 0.34 {ES}) (p {\textless} 0.05). However, no signiﬁcant differences in either performance variable were evident when the skill-based warm-up was preceded by static stretching or a dynamic warm-up routine. This suggests that the practice of a subsequent high-intensity skill based warm-up restored the differences between the two warm-up interventions. Hence, if static stretching is to be included in the warm-up period, it is recommended that a period of high-intensity sport-speciﬁc skills based activity is included prior to the on-court/ﬁeld performance.},

	abstract = {To examine the acute effects of static stretching on countermovement vertical-jump ({CMVJ}) ability and monitor the time course of any stretch-induced changes.
Once familiarized, 16 experienced jumpers completed 2 testing sessions in a randomized order. Each session consisted of a general warm-up, a pretreatment {CMVJ} assessment, a treatment, and multiple posttreatment {CMVJ} assessments. One treatment included lower-body static stretching, and the second treatment, involving no stretching, was the control. Posttreatment {CMVJ} measures occurred immediately, 3, 6, 12, and 24 minutes posttreatment. Stretching consisted of 3 static-stretching exercises, with each exercise repeated 3 times and each repetition held for 30 s.
Prestretch {CMVJ} height equaled 47.1 (+/- 9.7) cm. {CMVJ} height immediately poststretch was 45.7 (+/- 9.2) cm, and it remained depressed during the 24-min follow-up period. Pre-no-stretch {CMVJ} height was 48.4 (+/- 9.8) cm, whereas immediately post-no-stretch {CMVJ} height equaled 46.8 (+/- 9.5) cm, and as in the stretch treatment, post-no-stretch {CMVJ} height remained lower than pre-no-stretch values.Although there was a significant main effect of time (P = .005), indicating that {CMVJ} was lower and remained impaired after both treatments, no significant interaction effect (P = .749) was observed.
In comparison with the no-activity control, static stretching resulted in similar reductions in {CMVJ} ability when examined over the same time course, so athletes preparing for {CMVJ} should avoid periods of inactivity, as well as static stretching.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

	abstract = {Dynamic stretching has gained popularity, due to a number of studies showing an increase in high intensity performance compared to static stretch modalities. Twenty-four males (age mean 21 +/- 0.3 years) performed a standardised 10 min jogging warm-up followed by either; no stretching ({NS}), slow dynamic stretching at 50 b/min ({SDS}) or fast dynamic stretching at 100 b/min ({FDS}). Post-warm-up, squat, countermovement and depth jumps were performed. Heart rate, tympanic temperature, electromyography ({EMG}) and kinematic data (100 Hz) were collected during each jump. Results indicated that the {FDS} condition showed significantly greater jump height in all tests compared to the {SDS} and {NS} conditions. Further, the {SDS} trial resulted in significantly greater performance in the drop and squat jump compared to the {NS} condition. The reasons behind these performance changes are multi-faceted, but appear to be related to increases in heart rate and core temperature with slow dynamic stretches, while the greater increase in performance for the fast dynamic stretch intervention is linked to greater nervous system activation, shown by significant increases in {EMG}. In conclusion, a faster dynamic stretch component appears to prepare an athlete for a more optimum performance.},

	abstract = {Rugby league football originated in the north of England in the 1890’s and is now played globally. Participating nations in the southern hemisphere include Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Samoa, with only the British Isles (England, Scotland, and Wales), Ireland, and France representing the Northern Hemisphere. Currently, little data exists regarding the physical demands of professional rugby league, with evidence being solely represented through sub-elite10 and junior players.18 This knowledge however, is fundamental when designing strength and conditioning programmes and specific to this article, fitness testing
batteries.
Therefore, the purpose of this article is two fold. Firstly, to conduct a needs analysis of rugby league and thus identify the fundamental fitness parameters. Then secondly, compare and contrast tests deemed suitable to assess these and from which a testing battery will be advised. The fitness testing battery will also be considered based on the practical experience gained from working with professional rugby league teams. This is an important step in bridging the gap between the theory and
application of sport science, whereby the constraints of the work place can also be commented on.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Police officers require a certain amount of occupational fitness to successfully perform physically demanding tasks. As such, trainees are required to undergo training to develop their ability to perform such tasks. The physical competency test ({PCT}) is a 400 m obstacle course consisting of key police occupational physical tasks used to evaluate a trainee's ability to complete tasks that a police officer is expected to perform whilst on duty. The purpose of this study was to profile the {PCT} in a police recruit population to provide an indication of the current level of occupational fitness within a policing population to inform conditioning requirements. Retrospective data for 813 male (age = 27.41 ± 5.92 years, body mass = 83.98 ± 14.03 kg, height = 179.23 ± 10.50 cm, {BMI} = 25.85 ± 3.92 kg/m2) and 372 female (mean age = 27.01 ± 6.45 years, mean weight = 67.14 ± 8.60 kg, mean height = 168.14 ± 6.46 cm and mean {BMI} = 23.61 ± 2.52 kg/m2) police trainees from the New Zealand Police Constabulary Recruitment database were provided for analysis. Anthropometric data, including height, body mass, and {BMI} were provided, in addition to trainee {PCT} time. Data were split by sex and age. Significant differences were observed between sexes for all anthropometric measures and {PCT} time ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.001). Generally, in both the male and female groups, younger recruits tended to perform better than the older recruits with results between the “under 20” and the 20–24-year-old-age groups performing significantly better than the 35–39-year-old-age group in both sexes, and the 25–29-year-old-age group performing significantly better than the 35–39-year-old-age group in female officers. The data provided in this study provides a profile for performance of male and female recruits of various ages on the {PCT} in preparation for entry, or re-entry following injury, into the {NZ} Police. However, given that the {PCT} is considered a measure of occupational task performance, consideration should be given to the use of sex and age neutral requirements as the occupational tasks performed by police officers exhibit the same traits regardless of sex or age. Older trainees may therefore need conditioning to improve {PCT} times and subsequently occupational performance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background New Zealand children's health and fitness performance is declining over time, but whether this change is because of deterioration in all children's health and fitness performance or can be attributed to just a certain portion of the population, is unknown.
Objectives In this study, secular trends and distributional changes in health-related and performance-related fitness components among New Zealand primary school children aged 10 to 14 years between 1991 and 2003 were tracked.
Methods Health- and performance-related fitness parameters including height, weight, body mass index ({BMI}), flexibility, standing broad jump, 4×9-m agility run, abdominal curl-ups, and 550-m run were collected up to twice a year from 3306 children (10–14 years old) from a New Zealand school between 1991 and 2003.
Results Over the 12-year period, the boys' weight increased by 4.5 kg (95\% {CL} 2.7 to 6.2, or 0.8\% per year) and girls' by 3.9 kg (95\% {CL} 2.0 to 5.9, or 0.7\% per year). Mean {BMI} increased by 0.12 kg m−2 (0.6\%) and 0.11 kg m−2 (0.5\%) per year for boys and girls, respectively. Children's 550-m run performance declined by 1.5\% and 1.7\% per year for boys and girls, respectively. Little difference existed between children located in the highest performing and leanest percentiles in 1991 and 2003, but for children in the poorest performing and fattest percentiles, their results were substantially worse in 2003.
Conclusions These results suggest that the deterioration in the health-related and performance-related fitness components of New Zealand 10–14-year-olds is not homogeneous but skewed towards those children who are the heaviest and perform worst in fitness tests. Previous research on health-related fitness parameters among children in New Zealand is limited but shows secular trends of increasing body mass1 2 in conjunction with deteriorating aerobic fitness performance, muscular endurance and explosive muscular power.3 Internationally, similar increases in body mass have been observed in children since the 1980s.1 4 5 Secular trends of deteriorating health-related fitness performance have also been reported among children around the world,1 5 6 with the most significant decreases observed in aerobic performance. However, trends in health-related variables reported as changes in mean body mass index ({BMI}) and mean aerobic fitness performance do not reveal possible changes in the distribution of {BMI} or aerobic performance within the population. Changes in such measures may come about because of a shift in the entire population under investigation or a change in a portion of the population. It is not clear whether New Zealand's entire childhood population is becoming heavier and less aerobically fit or whether only a portion of the children are becoming even heavier and more unfit, with the remaining children showing little secular change. The aim of this study was to track secular trends and distributional changes in body weight and physical fitness parameters among New Zealand primary school children aged 10 to 14 years.},

Health-related fitness refers to those components of fitness that are related to health status. The safety and feasibility of a test battery designed for the assessment of {HRFI} were evaluated. Subjects and Methods. Middle-aged men (n=246) and women (n=254), evenly selected from five age cohorts of a random sample (N=826), were tested. The subjects had a mean age of 47.0 years ({SD}=7.9, range=37–57). Screening to identify subjects with health limitations was conducted by fitness testers who had master's degrees in sport or health sciences. Safety was assessed in terms of acute complications, delayed-onset muscle soreness ({DOMS}), and heart rate after each test. Subject exclusion and time costs were evaluated for feasibility. Results. No acute complications occurred. The leg function test caused severe {DOMS} among inactive women. The overall exclusion rate increased with age. Up to 27\% of subjects aged 52 and 57 years were excluded from muscle endurance tests, mainly due to self-reported heart disease or elevated blood pressures. Over 90\% of the subjects, however, qualified for balance, flexibility, muscle force, and walk tests. Conclusion and Discussion. The test battery offers a safe and feasible method for the assessment of {HRFI} in working-aged adults, with the limitation that the one-leg squat function test may cause {DOMS}, particularly in inactive women.},

	abstract = {The present study summarises the work developed by the {ALPHA} (Assessing Levels of Physical Activity) study and describes the procedures followed to select the tests included in the {ALPHA} health-related fitness test battery for children and adolescents. The authors reviewed physical fitness and health in youth findings from cross-sectional studies. The authors also performed three systematic reviews dealing with (1) the predictive validity of health-related fitness, (2) the criterion validity of field-based fitness tests and (3) the reliability of field-based fitness tests in youth. The authors also carried out 11-methodological studies to determine the criterion validity and the reliability of several field-based fitness tests for youth. Finally, the authors performed a study in the school setting to examine the reliability, feasibility and safety of the selected tests. The selected fitness tests were (1) the 20 m shuttle run test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness; (2) the handgrip strength and (3) standing broad jump to assess musculoskeletal fitness, and (4) body mass index, (5) skinfold thickness and (5) waist circumference to assess body composition. When there are time limits, the authors propose the high-priority {ALPHA} health-related fitness test battery, which comprises all the evidence-based fitness tests except the measurement of the skinfold thickness. The time required to administer this battery to a group of 20 youth by one physical education teacher is less than 2 h. In conclusion, the {ALPHA} fitness tests battery is valid, reliable, feasible and safe for the assessment of health-related physical fitness in children and adolescents to be used for health monitoring purposes at population level.},

In study B, a population sample (n = 510) of 37- to 57-year-old men and women was selected. Main Outcome Measures: Intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated measures was used to assess inter-rater reliability. The degree of measurement error was expressed as the standard error of measurement. The mean difference with 95\% confidence intervals between the testing days or test trials was used to assess test-retest or trial-to-trial reproducibility. The coefficient of variation ({CV} = [{SD}/mean] × 100\%) from day to day was also calculated. Results: The following tests appeared to provide acceptable reliability as methods for field assessment of {HRF}: standing on one leg with eyes open for balance, side-bending of the trunk for spinal flexibility, modified push-ups for upper body muscular function, and jump and reach and one leg squat for leg muscular function. Conclusions: This reliability assessment provided useful information on the characteristics of potential test items in a {HRF} test battery for adults and on the limitations of its practical use.

The risk benefit ratio of physical exercise differs between young competitive athletes and middle-age/senior individuals engaged in leisure-time sports activity. Competitive sports are associated with an increase in the risk of sudden cardiovascular death ({SCD}) in susceptible adolescents and young adults with underlying cardiovascular disorders. In middle-age/older individuals, physical activity can be regarded as a ‘two-edged sword': vigorous exertion increases the incidence of acute coronary events in those who did not exercise regularly, whereas habitual physical activity reduces the overall risk of myocardial infarction and {SCD}. Although cardiovascular pre-participation evaluation offers the potential to identify athletes with life-threatening cardiovascular abnormalities before onset of symptoms and may reduce their risk of {SCD}, there is a significant debate among cardiologists about efficacy, impact of false-positive results and cost-effectiveness of routine screening.

          To develop and validate a concise survey that will identify athletes who possess elevated injury risk.
          Design: 
          Cohort study.
          Setting: 
          National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletic program.
          Participants: 
          Cohorts of 188 and 146 college athletes who participated during successive academic years.
          Assessment of Risk Factors: 
          The first cohort provided responses to 4 joint-specific outcome surveys that were related to subsequent time-loss injury occurrence. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified survey items that provided best discrimination, which were combined with a negative life event stress item to create a new 10-item survey. The second cohort provided responses to the new survey, which were converted to a 0 to 100 score.
          Main Outcome Measures: 
          Construct validity was assessed through documentation of time-loss injuries sustained during the preceding 12 months and predictive validity was assessed through prospective documentation of sport-related sprains and strains. Cronbach alpha was calculated to assess internal consistency.
          Results: 
          Each of the outcome survey items used to develop the new survey demonstrated much greater specificity than sensitivity. Both the retrospective and prospective receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) analyses identified scores of 96 and 88 as cut-points that provided good discrimination between injured and noninjured cases. The area under the curve was 0.69 (P {\textless} 0.001) for the retrospective analysis and 0.62 (P = 0.016) for the prospective analysis. Cronbach alpha was 0.89 (90\% {CI}, 0.86-0.91).
          Conclusions: 
          Self-reported effects of previous injury may be one method to efficiently identify athletes who possess elevated injury risk, and subsequently deliver preventive interventions, thereby providing an alternative method to time-intensive functional testing.},

	abstract = {There are several methods used in sports science to identify asymmetries in athletes, given their purported relevance to injury prevention and performance optimization. We aimed to verify whether asymmetries provided by isokinetic assessments, jump tests, and tensiomyography ({TMG}) are associated with each other, and whether their respective functional indices are related to jumping ability. {TMG} parameters, unilateral and bilateral squat-jump ({SJ}) and countermovement-jump ({CMJ}) performances, and peak torque in knee-extension and flexion with angular velocities of 60o/s and 300o/s for twenty-four soccer players were retained for analyses. Asymmetry was detected by examining the percentage difference between dominant and non-dominant legs. The median-split technique was used to identify the best and worst performers in {SJ} and {CMJ} tests. Results revealed that the asymmetries detected in the three different methods were not interrelated. Curiously, better performances in {SJ} and {CMJ} tests were associated with higher asymmetry levels. Furthermore, only the knee-extension peak torque at both angular velocities was correlated moderately to largely (r=0.48-0.66) with jump performance. Despite their recognized ability to predict the risk of injury, the absence of interrelationships between {TMG}, isokinetic tests, and unilateral jumps precludes their single use as a unique functional screening diagnostic. Finally, and very importantly, lower-limb asymmetry is not necessarily related to impaired vertical jump performance in soccer players.},

The purpose of this study was to: (1) establish the reliability of a new unilateral concentric only horizontal jump assessment ({HSJ}) then compare the reliability of this test to other types of unilateral vertical and horizontal jumps; (2) compare the tests to whether they differ in their ability to determine limb asymmetries; and (3) investigate the relationship between these jumps and sprint running.
Methods
Eighteen sportsmen performed unilateral jump assessments involving the horizontal squat jump, horizontal countermovement jump, horizontal repetitive jump, vertical squat jump, vertical countermovement jump, and vertical repetitive jump.
Results
Reliability for the new test was found to be the equal if not better than the other more established tests of leg power, with the within trial variation ({CV}=1.1–1.9\%) and test–retest reliability ({ICC}=0.89–0.90). None of the tests were found to have greater discriminative ability in determining limb asymmetries. Stretch shorten cycle enhancement was greater in the vertical tests (12.1\%) compared to the horizontal tests (1.3\%). Horizontal jump assessments (r=−0.73 to −0.86) were found better predictors of 20-m sprint performance than the vertical assessments (r=−0.52 to −0.73), with the horizontal cyclic assessment being the best predictor (r=−0.86).
Conclusion
Horizontal leg power assessment appears an inexpensive, easy to administer, reliable and valid method to assess unilateral leg power.},

To evaluate and compare 4 different methods commonly used to measure vertical jump performance, 52 physically active men each performed 5 maximal vertical jumps. Kinetic and kinematic data were used to analyze each trial using the 4 methods: a criterion test based on body center of mass displacement ({VJPT}), 2 methods based on vertical takeoff velocity as calculated from the force platform, and 1 method based on time in the air ({JUMPAIR}). All 4 methods showed excellent reliability (R {\textgreater} .97). Using {VJPT} as the criterion, the other 3 methods showed excellent coefficients of validity (R {\textgreater} .95) but poor accuracy: The obtained vertical jump height scores were statistically different among all methods (p {\textless} .01). {JUMPAIR} is considered a relatively simple and inexpensive method to obtain valid and reliable measures of vertical jump performance without an arm swing, provided the appropriate adjustments are made to the jump results.},

Performance of squat, countermovement, and drop jumps with different dropping heights was assessed on the Jump-and-Reach Test and the measurement of flight time, then compared across different jump trials. The very high reliability coefficients of both assessment methods and the lower correlation coefficients between scores on the assessments indicate a very high consistency of each method but only moderate covariation, which means that they measure partly different items. As a consequence, the Jump-and-Reach Test has good ecological validity in situations when reaching height during the flight phase is critical for performance (e.g., basketball and volleyball) but only limited accuracy for the assessment of vertical impulse production with different jump techniques and conditions.},

The {VJ} flight times assessed using an optical mat (Optojump) and an accelerometer-based (Myotest) system were compared with that of a force platform. The flight times recorded during a countermovement jump ({CMJ}) were collected from 20 rugby players (n = 86 jumps) concurrently using the 3 tracking systems. Significant bias between the Force platform and either the Optojump (bias = 0.006 ± 0.007; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.004–0.007 seconds) and Myotest (bias = −0.031 ± 0.021; 95\% {CI} 0.035 to −0.026s; p {\textless} 0.0001) occurred. A nearly perfect correlation was found between force platform and Optojump (r = 0.99; 95\% {CI} 0.098–0.99; p {\textless} 0.0001). Force platform and Myotest (r = 0.89; 95\% {CI} 0.084–0.93; p {\textless} 0.0001) flight times showed very large association. Difference between Optojump and Myotest systems was significant (−0.036 ± 0.021 seconds; 95\% {CI} −0.041 to −0.032; p {\textless} 0.0001), which results in Myotest mean flight time being approximately 7.2\% longer than the Optojump flight time. The association between Optojump and Myotest was nearly perfect (r = 0.91, 95\% {CI} 0.86–0.94; p {\textless} 0.0001). This study showed that the Optojump and Myotest systems possess convergent validity and can be successfully used under field conditions to assess {VJ} while performing a {CMJ}.

J Strength Cond Res 26(9): 2447–2452, 2012—The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of 3 different stretching methods combined with a warm-up protocol on vertical jump performance. Sixteen young tennis players (14.5 ± 2.8 years; 175 ± 5.6 cm; 64.0 ± 11.1 kg) were randomly assigned to 4 different experimental conditions on 4 successive days. Each session consisted of a general and specific warm-up, with 5 minutes of running followed by 10 jumps, accompanied by one of the subsequent conditions: (a) Control Condition ({CC})—5 minutes of passive rest; (b) Passive Stretching Condition ({PSC})—5 minutes of passive static stretching; (c) Active Stretching Condition ({ASC})—5 minutes of active static stretching; and (d) Dynamic Stretching Condition ({DC})—5 minutes of dynamic stretching. After each intervention, the subjects performed 3 squat jumps ({SJs}) and 3 countermovement jumps ({CMJs}), which were measured electronically. For the {SJ}, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance ({CC} × {PSC} × {ASC} × {DC}) revealed significant decreases for {ASC} (28.7 ± 4.7 cm; p = 0.01) and {PSC} (28.7 ± 4.3 cm; p = 0.02) conditions when compared with {CC} (29.9 ± 5.0 cm). For {CMJs}, there were no significant decreases (p {\textgreater} 0.05) when all stretching conditions were compared with the {CC}. Significant increases in {SJ} performance were observed when comparing the {DC} (29.6 ± 4.9 cm; p = 0.02) with {PSC} (28.7 ± 4.3 cm). Significant increases in {CMJ} performance were observed when comparing the conditions {ASC} (34.0 ± 6.0 cm; p = 0.04) and {DC} (33.7 ± 5.5 cm; p = 0.03) with {PSC} (32.6 ± 5.5 cm).

Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between varying amounts of acute static stretching on jumping performance. By systematically increasing the amount of stretching, possible differences in jump height may be discovered, defining a line where acute static stretching becomes detrimental to performance. Ten collegiate athletes and 10 recreational athletes completed 3 different stretching treatments and 1 control treatment on different days in a within-treatment design. Stretching treatments consisted of 2, 4, or 6 sets of stretches, with each stretch held for 15 seconds with a 15-second rest. Stretches were done to the quadriceps, hamstrings, and plantar flexors. Upon arrival, each subject performed a 5-minute warm-up on a stationary upright cycle. After a brief rest period, participants performed 3 trials of a vertical jump test, followed by one of the treatment protocols. After another rest period, a second set of vertical jump trials was performed. Post-6 sets was significantly lower than Pre-6 sets (p ≤ 0.05). Additionally, Post-6 sets was significantly lower than Pre-4 sets, Pre-2 sets, and Pre-control (p ≤ 0.05). No other conditions were significantly different. In conclusion, 6 sets of stretches, or 90 seconds per muscle group, should not be performed before power activities such as jumping where optimal performance is desired.},

Twelve female collegiate volleyball players (mean ± {SD}; age 19.5 ± 1.1 yr; height 1.71 ± 0.06 m; mass 71.3 ± 8.54 kg) volunteered for this study.

The order of the stretching protocols was randomized for each subject. During each testing session, all subjects performed a 5-minute light jog as a warm-up, followed by 8 minutes of 1 of the stretching protocols. One minute after the completion of each protocol, 5 maximal {CMJ} were performed on a force platform, with each jump separated by 1 minute of passive recovery. Jump heights were calculated by integrating the vertical force trace. There were no significant differences between the {SS}, {DS}, and {NS} conditions for any of the jumps (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Despite the lack of significant effects for the group, there were notable individual responses to each of the warm-up conditions.

Ten minutes of dynamic stretching is sufficient to potentiate vertical jump performance characteristics. J Strength Cond Res 25(9): 2453-2463, 2011—The current literature recommends dynamic rather than static stretching for the athletic warm-up. Dynamic stretching and various conditioning stimuli are used to induce potentiation in subsequent athletic performance. However, it is unknown as to which type of activity in conjunction with dynamic stretching within a warm-up provides the optimal potentiation of vertical jump performance. It was the objective of the study to examine the possible potentiating effect of various types of conditioning stimuli with dynamic stretching. Twenty athletes participated in 6 protocols. All the experimental protocols included 10 minutes of dynamic stretching. After the dynamic stretching, the subjects performed a (a) concentric ({DS}/{CON}): 3 sets of 3 repetition maximum deadlift exercise; (b) isometric ({DS}/{ISOM}): 3 sets of 3-second maximum voluntary contraction back squats; (c) plyometric ({DS}/{PLYO}): 3 sets of 3 tuck jumps; (d) eccentric ({DS}/{ECC}): 3 modified drop jumps; (e) dynamic stretching only ({DS}), and (f) control protocol ({CON}). Before the intervention and at recovery periods of 15 seconds, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 minutes, the participants performed 1-2 maximal countermovement jumps. The {DS} and {DS}/{CON} protocols generally had a 95-99\% likelihood of exceeding the smallest worthwhile change for vertical jump height, peak power, velocity and force. However, the addition of the deadlift to the {DS} did not augment the potentiating effect. Time-to-peak potentiation was variable between individuals but was most consistent between 3 and 5 minutes. Thus, the volume and the intensity associated with 10 minutes of dynamic stretching were sufficient to provide the potentiation of vertical jump characteristics. Additional conditioning activities may promote fatigue processes, which do not permit further potentiation.},

However, jumping performance had fully recovered 15 minutes after all stretching conditions. In conclusion, vertical jump performance is diminished for 15 minutes if performed after static or {PNF} stretching, whereas ballistic stretching has little effect on jumping performance.

J Strength Cond Res 28(5): 1263–1271, 2014—The aim of this study was to evaluate 3 different flexibility techniques: (a) ballistic stretching ({BS}), (b) proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching ({PNF}) + {BS}, and (c) {PNF} + static stretching ({SS}) on vertical jump ({VJ}) performance and to determine the most appropriate stretching method during warm-up period before explosive force disciplines. One hundred voluntary male athletes participated in this study. All subjects performed aerobic warm-up (5-minute jog) followed by {BS} (5 seconds for each stretching exercise), {PNF} + {BS} ({PNF} performed followed by 5 seconds of {BS}), and {PNF} + {SS} ({PNF} performed followed by 30 seconds of {SS}) treatment protocol, respectively in the same day. Each stretching treatment was applied for 4 sets bilaterally. In all stretching treatments, lumbar extensor, gluteus maximus, and hamstring muscles were stretched with a single stretching exercise. After a 2-minute brief rest period, participants performed 3 trials of {VJ} test followed by one of the treatment protocols. Vertical jump performance was evaluated by countermovement jump ({CMJ}). Participants were divided into 3 groups according to their flexibility and prejump performances after warm-up. For each individual group and the whole group, after all treatments, differences in {CMJ} values were obtained (p ≤ 0.05). Ballistic stretching increased the {VJ} performance in the groups with low and average flexibility, poor prejumping performance, and also in the whole group (p ≤ 0.05). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching + {BS} affected {VJ} performance in the group of participants with high flexibility (p ≤ 0.05). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation + {SS} decreased {VJ} performance in groups of participants with high flexibility, moderate, and high prejumping performance and in whole group (p ≤ 0.05). Ballistic stretching method increased {VJ} height, therefore seems to be more suitable than {PNF} + {SS} and {PNF} + {BS} before events that rely on explosive power as a part of warm-up period.},

	abstract = {The acute effect of stretching on the kinematics of the vertical jump was investigated in a sample of 20 young adults. Sagittal plane videography (60 Hz) was used to measure the kinematics of vertical jumps after 2 warm-up routines, control and stretching. Subjects were tested on 2 occasions with warm-up routine randomized. There were no significant changes in vertical velocity knee angle, or the durations of the eccentric and concentric phases as a result of stretching despite good statistical power for the tests. Fifty-five percent of the subjects had lower vertical velocities (-7.5\%) after stretching, while 45 percent of the subjects had no change (10\%) or higher vertical (35\%) velocities (2.4\%) after stretching. Stretching prior to stretch-shortening cycle activities like the vertical jump results in small decreases in performance in some subjects, but the nonsignificant biomechanical changes suggest that neuromuscular inhibition may be the mechanism rather than changes in muscle stiffness.},

J Strength Cond Res 22(6): 1844-1849, 2008- Stretching before performance is a common practice among athletes in hopes of increasing performance and reducing the risk of injury. However, cumulative results indicate a negative impact of static stretching and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation ({PNF}) on performance; thus, there is a need for evaluating other stretching strategies for effective warm-up. The purpose of this study was to compare the differences between two sets of ballistic stretching and two sets of a dynamic stretching routine on vertical jump performance. Twenty healthy male and female college students between the ages of 22 and 34 (24.8 ± 3 years) volunteered to participate in this study. All subjects completed three individual testing sessions on three nonconsecutive days. On each day, the subjects completed one of three treatments (no stretch, ballistic stretch, and dynamic stretch). Intraclass reliability was determined using the data obtained from each subject. A paired samples t-test revealed no significant difference in jump height, force, or power when comparing no stretch with ballistic stretch. A significant difference was found on jump power when comparing no stretch with dynamic stretch, but no significant difference was found for jump height or force. Statistics showed a very high reliability when measuring jump height, force, and power using the Kistler Quattro Jump force plate. It seems that neither dynamic stretching nor ballistic stretching will result in an increase in vertical jump height or force. However, dynamic stretching elicited gains in jump power poststretch.},

J Strength Cond Res 23(2): 507-512, 2009-The results of previous research have demonstrated that static stretching ({SS}) can reduce muscular performance and that dynamic stretching ({DS}) can enhance muscular performance. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of {SS} and {DS} on vertical jump ({VJ}) performance and electromyographic ({EMG}) activity of the m. vastus medialis. Eleven healthy men (age 21 ± 2 years) took part in 3 conditions (no stretching [{NS}], {SS}, and {DS}), on separate occasions in a randomized, crossover design. During each condition, measurements of {VJ} height and {EMG} activity during the {VJ} were recorded. A repeated-measures analysis of variance and post hoc analysis indicated that {VJ} height was significantly less (4.19 ± 4.47\%) after {SS} than {NS} (p {\textless} 0.05) and significantly greater (9.44 ± 4.25\%) in {DS} than {SS} (p {\textless} 0.05). There was significantly greater {EMG} amplitude in the {DS} compared with the {SS} (p {\textless} 0.05). The results demonstrated that {SS} has a negative influence on {VJ} performance, whereas {DS} has a positive impact. Increased {VJ} performance after {DS} may be attributed to postactivation potentiation, whereas the reduction in {VJ} performance after {SS} may be attributable to neurological impairment and a possible alteration in the viscoelastic properties of the muscular tendon unit ({MTU}). This investigation provides some physiological basis for the inclusion of {DS} and exclusion of {SS} in preparation for activities requiring jumping performance.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to build on previous conflicting research on performance following stretching and secondary activity post-stretching. Using a randomized, cross-over design, 15 male participants completed a 5-min warm-up jog, followed by a maximal vertical jump ({VJ}1) and a repetitive five-repetition jump ({VJ}5) on a force mat, an intervention (static stretching, dynamic range of movement stretching, or no-stretching control), then a second maximal vertical jump and repetitive five-repetition jump, followed by a change of direction test (505 test) and a straight line sprint (20-m). Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures showed significant time and group × time interaction effects for both mean maximal {VJ}1 and {VJ}5 jump heights (P{\textless}0.001). Time course changes showed {VJ}1 jump height following static stretching was significantly reduced (7\%) compared with the dynamic and control conditions, which improved by 5.0\% and 3.9\% (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04) respectively. Following the second bout of movement activity, {VJ}1 jump height had improved, but was not significantly different from baseline value (P = 0.11). Similarly, {VJ}5 jump height following static stretching was significantly reduced (6.2\%) compared with the dynamic and control conditions, which showed improvements of 6.7\% and 7.5\% (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01) respectively. After the second bout of movement activity, mean {VJ}5 jump height for the static stretching group returned to baseline values (P = 0.84), while further improvements were observed in the dynamic (3.2\%) and control groups (2.2\%) (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04 respectively). Significant improvements in the 505 test were observed in the dynamic and control conditions, in both legs (range 2.45–3.67\%; P{\textless}0.001), compared with the static stretching condition. Although sprint time improved following the second bout of movement activity, no differences were observed in the 20-m sprint between conditions. The results of this study confirm previous findings that static stretching reduces vertical jump height that is not reversed with follow-up movement activity. Moreover, the results show that activities requiring rapid changes of direction and speed may also be affected if preceded by a bout of static stretching, and is not reversed with follow-up movement activities. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {PUBLISHER}},

	abstract = {Purpose: The present study addressed the lack of data on the effect of different types of stretching on diurnal variations in vertical jump height - i.e., squat-jump ({SJ}) and countermovement-jump ({CMJ}). We hypothesized that dynamic stretching could affect the diurnal variations of jump height by producing a greater increase in short-term maximal performance in the morning than the evening through increasing core temperature at this time-of-day. Methods: Twenty male soccer players (age, 18.6±1.3 yrs; height, 174.6±3.8 cm; body-mass, 71.1±8.6 kg; mean ± {SD}) completed the {SJ} and {CMJ} tests either after static stretching, dynamic stretching or no-stretching protocols at two times of day, 07:00 h and 17:00 h, with a minimum of 48 hours between testing sessions. One minute after warming-up for 5 minutes by light jogging and performing one of the three stretching protocols (i.e., static stretching, dynamic stretching or no-stretching) for 8 minutes, each subject completed the {SJ} and {CMJ} tests. Jumping heights were recorded and analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures (3 [stretching]×2 [time-of-day]). Results: The {SJ} and {CMJ} heights were significantly higher at 17:00 than 07:00 h (p{\textless}0.01) after the no-stretching protocol. These daily variations disappeared (i.e., the diurnal gain decreased from 4.2±2.81\% (p{\textless}0.01) to 1.81±4.39\% (not-significant) for {SJ} and from 3.99±3.43\% (p{\textless}0.01) to 1.51±3.83\% (not-significant) for {CMJ}) after dynamic stretching due to greater increases in {SJ} and {CMJ} heights in the morning than the evening (8.4±6.36\% vs. 4.4±2.64\%, p{\textless}0.05 for {SJ} and 10.61±5.49\% vs. 6.03±3.14\%, p{\textless}0.05 for {CMJ}). However, no significant effect of static stretching on the diurnal variations of {SJ} and {CMJ} heights was observed. Conclusion: Dynamic stretching affects the typical diurnal variations of {SJ} and {CMJ} and helps to counteract the lower morning values in vertical jump height.},

	abstract = {This target article addresses the role of storage and reutilization of elastic energy in stretch-shortening cycles. It is argued that for discrete movements such as the vertical jump, elastic energy does not explain the work enhancement due to the prestretch. This enhancement seems to occur because the prestretch allows muscles to develop a high level of active state and force before starting to shorten. For cyclic movements in which stretch-shortening cycles occur repetitively, some authors have claimed that elastic energy enhances mechanical efficiency. In the current article it is demonstrated that this claim is often based on disputable concepts such as the efficiency of positive work or absolute work, and it is argued that elastic energy cannot affect mechanical efficiency simply because this energy is not related to the conversion of metabolic energy into mechanical energy. A comparison of work and efficiency measures obtained at different levels of organization reveals that there is in fact no decisive evidence to either support or reject the claim that the stretch-shortening cycle enhances muscle efficiency. These explorations lead to the conclusion that the body of knowledge about the mechanics and energetics of the stretch-shortening cycle is in fact quite lean. A major challenge is to bridge the gap between knowledge obtained at different levels of organization, with the ultimate purpose of understanding how the intrinsic properties of muscles manifest themselves under
              in-vivo
              -like conditions and how they are exploited in whole-body activities such as running. To achieve this purpose, a close cooperation is required between muscle physiologists and human movement scientists performing inverse and forward dynamic simulation studies of whole-body exercises.},

Following stretching, there was a significant 12\% decrement in {MVC} with no significant changes in the control group. Muscle inactivation as measured by the {ITT} and {iEMG} increased by 2.8\% and 20.2\%, respectively. While twitch forces significantly decreased 11.7\%, there was no change in tetanic force post-stretch. Although possible increases in muscle compliance affected twitch force, a lack of tetanic force change would suggest that post-stretch force decrements are more affected by muscle inactivation than changes in muscle elasticity.

              J Strength Cond Res
              36(5): 1245–1256, 2022—This study compared the influences of the stretch-shortening cycle and arm swing on vertical jump performance during static jumps ({SJs}), counter-movement jumps ({CMJs}), and {CMJs} with arm swing ({CMJAs}) in young male and female athletes. Twenty-one boys (age = 12.1 ± 1.1 years) and 21 girls (age = 12.1 ± 1.1 years) performed {SJs}, {CMJs}, and {CMJAs} on force plates that sampled at 1 {kHz}. Measurements included peak force, rate of force development, peak power ({PP}), eccentric impulse ({ECC}), concentric impulse ({CON}), estimated jump height ({JH}), and changes in {PP} and {JH} across vertical jumps. Measurements of growth included age, maturity offset, height, body mass, fat-free mass, and thigh muscle cross-sectional area. Analyses of variance were used to analyze growth measurements across sex, as well as vertical jump outcome measures. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationships between changes in {PP} and {JH} across vertical jumps and growth measurements. There were differences in {PP} and {JH} such that {SJ} {\textless} {CMJ} {\textless} {CMJA} (
              p
              {\textless} 0.001), and {ECC} such that {SJ} {\textless} {CMJA} {\textless} {CMJ} (
              p
              ≤ 0.048). Changes in {PP} were greater from the {SJ} to {CMJ} than {CMJ} to {CMJA} (
              p
              ≤ 0.001). The change in {PP} from the {SJ} to {CMJ} exhibited moderate-to-high relationships with growth measurements for boys and girls (
              r
              = 0.543–0.803). Because young children may not have the skeletal musculature or strength necessary to absorb and reapply large eccentric preloading forces, future studies should consider using the {CMJA}, rather than the {CMJ}, to maximize vertical jump performance and minimize {ECC}. Coaches and practitioners can expect approximately 27–33\% greater {PP} and 15–17\% greater estimated {JH} when an arm swing is included during the {CMJ}.},

Strength was assessed using {PT} values normalized for body mass. Concentric {TPT} measurements were also compared between the groups., Results: No differences in concentric {PT}/{BW} ratios or concentric {TPT} were evident between the groups (P {\textgreater} .05). Additionally, there were no differences in these measurements between the ankles for the same motion and speed between the ankles in the subjects with functional instability., Conclusions: Using the {SSC} protocol as a measure of ankle function and the stretch-reflex phenomenon, we found no evidence to support the notion that differences in strength and {TPT} in the active, conscious state exist between those with functional ankle instability and a group of healthy control subjects.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}When improving athletic performance in sports with high-speed strength demands such as soccer, basketball, or track and field, the most common training method might be resistance training and plyometrics. Since a link between strength capacity and speed strength exists and recently published literature suggested chronic stretching routines may enhance maximum strength and hypertrophy, this review was performed to explore potential benefits on athletic performance. Based on current literature, a beneficial effect of static stretching on jumping and sprinting performance was hypothesized. A systematic literature search was conducted using {PubMed}, Web of Science and Google scholar. In general, 14 studies revealed 29 effect sizes ({ES}) (20 for jumping, nine for sprinting). Subgroup analyses for jump performance were conducted for short- long- and no stretch shortening cycle trials. Qualitative evaluation was supplemented by performing a multilevel meta-analysis via R (Package: metafor). Significant positive results were documented in six out of 20 jump tests and in six out of nine sprint tests, while two studies reported negative adaptations. Quantitative data analyses indicated a positive but trivial magnitude of change on jumping performance ({ES}:0.16, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 0.04), while all subgroup analyses did not support a positive effect ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 0.09–0.44). No significant influence of static stretching on sprint performance was obtained ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 0.08). Stretching does not seem to induce a sufficient stimulus to meaningfully enhance jumping and sprinting performance, which could possibly attributed to small weekly training volumes or lack of intensity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
