  abstract = {The early identification of talented individuals has become increasingly important across many performance domains. Current talent identification (TI) schemes in sport typically select on the basis of discrete, unidimensional measures at unstable periods in the athlete's development. In this article, the concept of talent is revised as a complex, dynamical system in which future behaviors emerge from an interaction of key performance determinants such as psychological behaviors, motor abilities, and physical characteristics. Key nonlinear dynamics concepts are related to TI approaches such as sensitivity to initial conditions, transitions, and exponential behavioral distributions. It is concluded that many TI models place an overemphasis on early identification rather than the development of potentially talented performers. A generic model of talent identification and development is proposed that addresses these issues and provides direction for future research.},

Because osteoporosis is such a prevalent disease with life-threatening consequences, it is important to try to maximize PBM. Adolescence is a critical period for bone acquisition. This article discusses some of the differences in male and female skeletal development and modifiable factors that enhance bone accrual in this age group, particularly in athletes. Hormonal influences, effects of physical activity, and nutritional contributions are included, with a focus on the adolescent athlete. Emphasis is placed on the importance of appropriate energy availability in this age group. We also review prevention and treatment strategies for the female athlete triad (ie, the inter-relationship of decreased energy availability, menstrual irregularity, and low bone density) in adolescents and athletic women. Recommendations for maximizing bone density in both male and female adolescents are discussed.},

Our group has developed an integrated cardiopulmonary model (CP Model) that mathematically describes the interactions between the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, along with their main short-term control mechanisms. The model has been compared with human and animal data taken from published literature. Due to the volume of the work, the paper is divided in two parts. The present paper is on model development and normophysiology, whereas the second is on the model's validation on hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions. The CP Model incorporates cardiovascular circulation, respiratory mechanics, tissue and alveolar gas exchange, as well as short-term neural control mechanisms acting on both the cardiovascular and the respiratory functions. The model is able to simulate physiological variables typically observed in adult humans under normal and pathological conditions and to explain the underlying mechanisms and dynamics.},

  abstract = {Background New Zealand children's health and fitness performance is declining over time, but whether this change is because of deterioration in all children's health and fitness performance or can be attributed to just a certain portion of the population, is unknown. Objectives In this study, secular trends and distributional changes in health-related and performance-related fitness components among New Zealand primary school children aged 10 to 14 years between 1991 and 2003 were tracked. Methods Health- and performance-related fitness parameters including height, weight, body mass index (BMI), flexibility, standing broad jump, 4×9-m agility run, abdominal curl-ups, and 550-m run were collected up to twice a year from 3306 children (10–14 years old) from a New Zealand school between 1991 and 2003. Results Over the 12-year period, the boys' weight increased by 4.5 kg (95\% CL 2.7 to 6.2, or 0.8\% per year) and girls' by 3.9 kg (95\% CL 2.0 to 5.9, or 0.7\% per year). Mean BMI increased by 0.12 kg m−2 (0.6\%) and 0.11 kg m−2 (0.5\%) per year for boys and girls, respectively. Children's 550-m run performance declined by 1.5\% and 1.7\% per year for boys and girls, respectively. Little difference existed between children located in the highest performing and leanest percentiles in 1991 and 2003, but for children in the poorest performing and fattest percentiles, their results were substantially worse in 2003. Conclusions These results suggest that the deterioration in the health-related and performance-related fitness components of New Zealand 10–14-year-olds is not homogeneous but skewed towards those children who are the heaviest and perform worst in fitness tests. Previous research on health-related fitness parameters among children in New Zealand is limited but shows secular trends of increasing body mass1 2 in conjunction with deteriorating aerobic fitness performance, muscular endurance and explosive muscular power.3 Internationally, similar increases in body mass have been observed in children since the 1980s.1 4 5 Secular trends of deteriorating health-related fitness performance have also been reported among children around the world,1 5 6 with the most significant decreases observed in aerobic performance. However, trends in health-related variables reported as changes in mean body mass index (BMI) and mean aerobic fitness performance do not reveal possible changes in the distribution of BMI or aerobic performance within the population. Changes in such measures may come about because of a shift in the entire population under investigation or a change in a portion of the population. It is not clear whether New Zealand's entire childhood population is becoming heavier and less aerobically fit or whether only a portion of the children are becoming even heavier and more unfit, with the remaining children showing little secular change. The aim of this study was to track secular trends and distributional changes in body weight and physical fitness parameters among New Zealand primary school children aged 10 to 14 years.},

  abstract = {Metrnl is a secreted protein able to activate different intracellular signaling pathways in adipocytes, macrophages, myocytes and cardiomyocytes with physiological effects of the browning of white adipose tissue (BWT), insulin sensitivity, inflammation inhibition, skeletal muscle regeneration and heart protection. Shown to be regulated by obesity, diabetes, caloric restriction, weight loss and heart diseases, Metrnl is definitely involved in metabolic turbulences, and may play roles in metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, due to the conflicting data yielded, Metrnl is still far from clinical application as a diagnostic and/or a therapeutic agent or even a therapeutic target in MetS-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Nevertheless, blood Metrnl levels as well as Metrnl as a cardiokine have been reported to play cardioprotective roles against heart diseases. Considering the established metabolic and anti-inflammatory hallmarks, exercise-induced Metrnl (as a myokine) is regarded as an exercise mediator in improving obesity-induced complications such as insulin resistance, T2D and inflammation. Besides, due to its healing role in muscle damage, Metrnl is also a potential therapeutic candidate to enhance regeneration with ageing or other inflammatory myopathies like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Therefore, there are still many exercise-related questions unanswered on Metrnl, such as Metrnl-mediated fat browning in humans, exercise effects on heart Metrnl production and secretion and the effects of other exercise-induced skeletal muscle stressors like hypoxia and oxidative in Metrnl production other than exercise-induced muscle damage. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Exercise-induced Metrnl actions are increased fat oxidation in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, the control of inflammation in adipose tissue (metainflammation), and the regulation of muscle regeneration. Based on the current knowledge, Metrnl as a myokine can establish the muscle-fat crosstalk; however, the ability of Metrnl as a myokine to create other crosstalks remains unclear yet.

  abstract = {Sarcopenic obesity is defined as a multifactorial disease in aging with decreased body muscle, decreased muscle strength, decreased independence, increased fat mass, due to decreased physical activity, changes in adipokines and myokines, and decreased satellite cells. People with sarcopenic obesity cause harmful changes in myokines and adipokines. These changes are due to a decrease interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-15 (IL-15), insulin-like growth factor hormone (IGF-1), irisin, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21), adiponectin, and apelin. While factors such as myostatin, leptin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and resistin increase. The consequences of these changes are an increase in inflammatory factors, increased degradation of muscle proteins, increased fat mass, and decreased muscle tissue, which exacerbates sarcopenia obesity. In contrast, exercise, especially strength training, reverses this process, which includes increasing muscle protein synthesis, increasing myogenesis, increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, increasing brown fat, reducing white fat, reducing inflammatory factors, and reducing muscle atrophy. Since some people with chronic diseases are not able to do high-intensity strength training, exercises with blood flow restriction (BFR) are newly recommended. Numerous studies have shown that low-intensity BFR training produces the same increase in hypertrophy and muscle strength such as high-intensity strength training. Therefore, it seems that exercise interventions with BFR can be an effective way to prevent the exacerbation of sarcopenia obesity. However, due to limited studies on adipokines and exercises with BFR in people with sarcopenic obesity, more research is needed. Copyright © 2022 Alizadeh Pahlavani.},

For state measures, athletes reported greater levels of concentration disruption when experiencing high levels of anxiety or high levels of happiness, and fewer disruptions in concentration when experiencing high levels of excitement. Findings also showed that excitement was associated with low levels of mental effort during good performances and high levels of mental effort during poor performances; anxiety and happiness were associated with high levels of mental effort during good performances and low levels of mental effort during poor performances. Taken together, these studies point towards potential benefits accompanying high levels of excitement and potential disadvantages accompanying high levels of anxiety and happiness.},

  abstract = {The association between the pathogenesis and natural course of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and skeletal muscle dysfunction is increasingly recognized. These obesity-associated disorders originate primarily from sustained caloric excess, gradually disrupting cellular and molecular mechanisms of the adipose–muscle–liver axis resulting in end-stage tissue injury exemplified by cirrhosis and sarcopenia. These major clinical phenotypes develop through complex organ–tissue interactions from the earliest stages of NAFLD. While the role of adipose tissue expansion and remodeling is well established in the development of NAFLD, less is known about the specific interplay between skeletal muscle and the liver in this process. Here, the relationship between skeletal muscle and liver in various stages of NAFLD progression is reviewed. Current knowledge of the pathophysiology is summarized with the goal of better understanding the natural history, risk stratification, and management of NAFLD.

  abstract = {Long-distance running is an exhausting effort for the whole organism. Prolonged aerobic exercise induces changes in inflammatory markers. However, predicting muscle damage in response has limitations in terms of selecting biomarkers used to measure inflammatory status. The present study conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis of articles focusing in ultra-marathon, marathon, and half-marathon and levels of cytokines. The search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, resulting in the inclusion of 76 articles. IL-6 was highlighted, evaluated in 62 studies and show increase in the standard mean difference (SMD): half-marathon (SMD −1.36; IC 95\%: −1.82, −0.89, Ch2:0.58; tau2:0.00; p \&lt; 0.0001), marathon (SMD −6.81; IC 95\%: −9.26, −4.37; Ch2:481.37 tau2:11.88; p \&lt; 0.0001) and ultra-marathon (SMD −8.00 IC 95\%: −10.47, −5.53; Ch2:328.40; tau2:14.19; p \&lt; 0.0001). In contrast meta-regression analysis did not show relationship to the running distance (p = 0.864). The meta-analysis evidenced increase in the concentration of IL-1ra (p \&lt; 0.0001), IL-1B (p \&lt; 0.0001), IL-8 (p \&lt; 0.0001), IL-10 (p \&lt; 0.0001) and TNF-α (p \&lt; 0.0001). Reduction in IL-2 (p \&lt; 0.0001) and INF-y (p \&lt; 0.03) and no change in the IL-4 (p \&lt; 0.56). The number of studies evaluating the effect of adipokines was limited, however Leptin and Resistin were recurrent. The effects of an acute bout of prolonged aerobic exercise will protect against chronic systemic inflammation. The time to return to baseline values showed a substantial and dose-dependent relationship with run volume. The concentration of IL-6 was robustly studied and the marathon running was the most explored. Network of endocrine interactions in which circulating factors, released in extreme exercises, interplay through inter-organ crosstalk and physiologic changes were expressed. The running volume variability was able to modulate compounds that play a fundamental role in the maintenance of homeostasis and cell signaling.

  abstract = {Adipose tissue is a critical regulator of systemic metabolism and bodily homeostasis as it secretes a myriad of adipokines, including inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. As the main storage pool of lipids, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues undergo marked hypertrophy and hyperplasia in response to nutritional excess leading to hypoxia, adipokine dysregulation, and subsequent low-grade inflammation that is characterized by increased infiltration and activation of innate and adaptive immune cells. The specific localization, physiology, susceptibility to inflammation and the heterogeneity of the inflammatory cell population of each adipose depot are unique and thus dictate the possible complications of adipose tissue chronic inflammation. Several lines of evidence link visceral and particularly perivascular, pericardial, and perirenal adipose tissue inflammation to the development of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the implication of the immune system in the regulation of adipose tissue function, adipose tissue immune components are pivotal in detrimental or otherwise favorable adipose tissue remodeling and thermogenesis. Adipose tissue resident and infiltrating immune cells undergo metabolic and morphological adaptation based on the systemic energy status and thus a better comprehension of the metabolic regulation of immune cells in adipose tissues is pivotal to address complications of chronic adipose tissue inflammation. In this review, we discuss the role of adipose innate and adaptive immune cells across various physiological and pathophysiological states that pertain to the development or progression of cardiovascular diseases associated with metabolic disorders. Understanding such mechanisms allows for the exploitation of the adipose tissue-immune system crosstalk, exploring how the adipose immune system might be targeted as a strategy to treat cardiovascular derangements associated with metabolic dysfunctions. © 2020 AlZaim, Hammoud, Al-Koussa, Ghazi, Eid and El-Yazbi.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serum cytokines are increased in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and predict increased mortality. It is widely assumed that increased renal production of cytokines is the source of increased serum cytokines; the role of extra-renal cytokine production and impaired renal cytokine clearance is less well studied. We hypothesized that cytokine production in AKI was mononuclear phagocyte dependent, independent of production by the kidneys, and that serum cytokine clearance would be impaired in AKI. METHODS: Bilateral nephrectomy was used as a model of AKI to assess cytokine production independent of kidney cytokine production. Mononuclear phagocytes were depleted utilizing intravenous (IV) administration of liposome-encapsulated clodronate (LEC). Twenty-three serum cytokines were determined utilizing a multiplex cytokine kit. Proteins for cytokines were determined in the spleen and liver by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Recombinant cytokines were injected by IV into mice with bilateral nephrectomy to determine the effect of absent kidney function on serum cytokine clearance. RESULTS: Serum interleukin (IL)-6, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), IL-10, IL-1β, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), IL-5 and eotaxin were increased in the serum of mice after bilateral nephrectomy and were reduced with LEC. Serum IL-12p40 and regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted (RANTES) were increased after bilateral nephrectomy and were further increased with LEC. Spleen IL-6, CXCL1, IL-10 and IL-1β and liver IL-6 and IL-10 were increased after bilateral nephrectomy. After IV injection, IL-6, CXCL1, IL-10 and IL-1β had a prolonged serum cytokine appearance in mice with bilateral nephrectomy versus sham operation. CONCLUSIONS: Increased mononuclear phagocyte production and impaired renal clearance contribute to serum cytokine accumulation in AKI, independent of kidney injury. The effect of AKI on cytokine production and clearance may contribute to the increased mortality of patients with AKI.},

  abstract = {Frailty, a consequence of the interaction of the aging process and certain chronic diseases, compromises functional outcomes in the elderly and substantially increases their risk for developing disabilities and other adverse outcomes. Frailty follows from the combination of several impaired physiological mechanisms affecting multiple organs and systems. And, though frailty and sarcopenia are related, they are two different conditions. Thus, strategies to preserve or improve functional status should consider systemic function in addition to muscle conditioning. Physical activity/exercise is considered one of the main strategies to counteract frailty-related physical impairment in the elderly. Exercise reduces age-related oxidative damage and chronic inflammation, increases autophagy, and improves mitochondrial function, myokine profile, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway, and insulin sensitivity. Exercise interventions target resistance (strength and power), aerobic, balance, and flexibility work. Each type improves different aspects of physical functioning, though they could be combined according to need and prescribed as a multicomponent intervention. Therefore, exercise intervention programs should be prescribed based on an individual's physical functioning and adapted to the ensuing response. © 2020},

  abstract = {Background: Aging and low physical activity are associated with the development of diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity) marked by chronic low-grade inflammation. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death worldwide, while exercising muscle tissue can increase the secretion of myokines that can reestablish a possible inflammatory process in virtue of the anti-inflammatory effect. Methods: The objective of this review is to focus on molecular mechanisms involved between different kinds of exercise and cellular oxidative stress, and the emerging therapeutic strategies which have the potential to promote benefits in vascular health. Results: Regular exercise increases shear stress, mitochondrial biogenesis, and upregulates mitochondrial antioxidant system, inducing anti-inflammatory actions, such as suppression of TNF-α which may offer protection against TNF-α-induced vascular impairment. Conclusion: Exercise training of various durations and intensities appears to prevent and restore the age-related impairment of endothelial function, likely through the restoration of NO availability, reduction in oxidative stress, and turnover of the apoptotic process in the endothelium, thus minimizing vascular inflammation and decreasing the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscles secrete various factors, such as proteins/peptides, nucleotides, and metabolites, which are referred to as myokines. Many of these factors are transported into extracellular bodily fluids in a free or protein-bound form. Furthermore, several secretory factors have been shown to be wrapped up by small vesicles, particularly exosomes, secreted into circulation, and subsequently regulate recipient cells. Thus, exosome contents can be recognized as myokines. In recipient cells, proteins, microRNAs, and metabolites in exosomes can regulate the expression and activity of target proteins associated with nutrient metabolism and immune function. The levels of circulating exosomes and their contents are altered in muscle disorders and metabolic-related states, such as metabolic dysfunction, sarcopenia, and physical fitness. Therefore, such circulating factors could mediate various interactions between skeletal muscle and other organs and may be useful as biomarkers reflecting physiological and pathological states associated with muscular function. Here, this review summarizes secretory regulation of muscle-derived exosomes. Their metabolic and immunological roles and the significance of their circulating levels are also discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Aoi and Tanimura.},

  abstract = {Cancer cachexia (CC) is a debilitating multifactorial syndrome, involving progressive deterioration and functional impairment of skeletal muscles. It affects about 80\% of patients with advanced cancer and causes premature death. No causal therapy is available against CC. In the last few decades, our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to muscle wasting during cancer has markedly increased. Both inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) alter anabolic and catabolic signaling pathways mostly culminating with muscle depletion. Several preclinical studies have emphasized the beneficial roles of several classes of nutraceuticals and modes of physical exercise, but their efficacy in CC patients remains scant. The route of nutraceutical administration is critical to increase its bioavailability and achieve the desired anti-cachexia effects. Accumulating evidence suggests that a single therapy may not be enough, and a bimodal intervention (nutraceuticals plus exercise) may be a more effective treatment for CC. This review focuses on the current state of the field on the role of inflammation and OS in the pathogenesis of muscle atrophy during CC, and how nutraceuticals and physical activity may act synergistically to limit muscle wasting and dysfunction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An athlete's intention to return to sport following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a major indication for surgical intervention. PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to determine postoperative return-to-sport outcomes after ACL reconstruction surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis and systematic review METHODS: Electronic databases including Medline, Embase, SPORTDiscus and CINAHL were searched from the earliest possible entry to April 2010. Studies were included that reported the number of patients returning to sports participation following ACL reconstruction surgery. The results were presented using the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as a framework and combined using proportion meta-analyses. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies evaluating 5770 participants at a mean follow-up of 41.5 months were included for review. Overall, 82\% of participants had returned to some kind of sports participation, 63\% had returned to their preinjury level of participation, and 44\% had returned to competitive sport at final follow-up. Approximately 90\% of participants achieved normal or nearly normal knee function when assessed postoperatively using impairment-based outcomes such as laxity and strength, and 85\% when using activity-based outcomes such as the International Knee Documentation Committee knee evaluation form. Fear of reinjury was the most common reason cited for a postoperative reduction in or cessation of sports participation. CONCLUSION: The relatively low rate of return to competitive sport despite the high rates of successful outcome in terms of knee impairment-based function suggests that other factors such as psychological factors may be contributing to return-to-sport outcomes.

Thus, we simulated both of these feeding                         trials.

Conclusions             It is becoming increasingly clear that our model (MBM) is perfectly able                         to predict body weight and body composition fluctuations under a wide                         variety of feeding experiments.                                                “There is a stupid humility that is not at all rare, and those afflicted                         with it are altogether unfit to become devotees of knowledge.

  abstract = {Sarcopenia is a common muscular affection among elderly individuals. More recently, it has been recognized as the skeletal muscle (SM) expression of the metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of sarcopenia is increasing along with visceral obesity, to which it is tightly associated. Nonetheless, it is a still underreported entity by clinicians, despite the worsening in disease burden and reduced patient quality of life. Recognition of sarcopenia is clinically challenging, and variability in study populations and diagnostic methods across the clinical studies makes it hard to reach a strong evidence. Impaired insulin activity in SM is responsible for the altered molecular pathways and clinical manifestations of sarcopenia, which is morphologically expressed by myosteatosis. Lipotoxicity, oxidative stress and adipose tissue-derived inflammation lead to both alterations in glucose disposal and protein synthesis in SM, with raising insulin resistance (IR) and SM atrophy. In particular, hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance interfere directly with SM activity, but also with the release of Growth Hormone from the hypohysis, leading to a lack in its anabolic effect on SM. Moreover, sarcopenia is independently associated to liver fibrosis in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), which in turn worsens SM functionality through the secretion of proinflammatory heptokines. The cross-talk between the liver and SM in the IR setting is of crucial relevance, given the high prevalence of NAFLD and the reciprocal impact of insulin-sensitive tissues on the overall disease burden. Along with the efforts of non-invasive diagnostic approaches, irisin and myostatin are two myokines currently evaluated as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognostication. Decreased irisin levels seem to be potentially associated to sarcopenia, whereas increased myostatin has shown to negatively impact on sarcopenia in pre-clinical studies. Gene variants in irisin have been explored with regard to the impact on the liver disease phenotype, with conflicting results. The gut-muscle axis has gain relevance with the evidence that insulin resistance-derived gut dysbiosis is responsible for increased endotoxemia and reduction in short-chain free fatty acids, directly affecting and predisposing to sarcopenia. Based on the current evidence, more efforts are needed to increase awareness and improve the management of sarcopenic patients. Copyright © 2021 Armandi, Rosso, Caviglia, Ribaldone and Bugianesi.},

  abstract = {Aging is associated with far-reaching changes in physiological functions resulting in morbidity and ultimately death. Age-related frailty, insecurity and reduced physical activity contribute to a progressive loss of muscle mass and function, commonly referred to as sarcopenia. Due to the increase in life expectancy in many countries, loss of muscle mass and its consequences gain in relevance for public health. At the same time, the molecular mechanisms that underlie sarcopenia are poorly understood and therefore, therapeutic approaches are limited. Interestingly though, endurance, strength and stretching exercise is significantly superior to all known pharmacological, nutritional and hormonal interventions for stabilizing, alleviating and reversing sarcopenia. Thus, increased knowledge about the plastic changes of skeletal muscle after physical activity and the signaling factors that mediate the beneficial effects of exercise on other organs might yield a better understanding of the disease and open new avenues for treatment. Here, we discuss how current discoveries about the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a key exercise factor in muscle, and myokines, factors produced and secreted by active muscle fibers, expand our view of the pathological changes and the therapeutic options for sarcopenia.

  abstract = {Background\enspace{} The current literature on the chronic effects of static stretching (SS) exercises on muscle strength and power is unclear and controversial. Objective\enspace{} We aimed to examine the chronic effects of SS exercises on muscle strength and power as well as flexibility in healthy individuals across the lifespan. Design\enspace{} Systematic review with meta-analysis of (randomized) controlled trials. Data Sources\enspace{} A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscus up to May 2022. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies\enspace{} We included studies that investigated the chronic effects of SS exercises on at least one muscle strength and power outcome compared to an active/passive control group or the contralateral leg (i.e., using between- or within-study designs, respectively) in healthy individuals, irrespective of age, sex, and training status. Results\enspace{} The main findings of 41 studies indicated trivial-to-small positive effects of chronic SS exercises on muscle strength (standardized mean difference [SMD]\,=\,0.21, [95\% confidence interval 0.10–0.32], p\,=\,0.001) and power (SMD\,=\,0.19, 95\% confidence interval 0.12–0.26], p\,{$<$}\,0.001). For flexibility, moderate-to-large increases were observed (SMD\,=\,0.96, [95\% confidence interval 0.70–1.22], p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Subgroup analyses, taking the participants’ training status into account, revealed a larger muscle strength improvement for sedentary (SMD\,=\,0.58, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) compared with recreationally active participants (SMD\,=\,0.16, p\,=\,0.029). Additionally, larger flexibility gains were observed following passive (SMD\,=\,0.97, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) compared with active SS exercises (SMD\,=\,0.59, p\,=\,0.001). The chronic effects of SS on muscle strength were moderated by the proportion of female individuals in the sample (β\,=\,0.004, p\,=\,0.042), with higher proportions experiencing larger gains. Other moderating variables included mean age (β\,=\,0.011, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), with older individuals showing larger muscle strength gains, and the number of repetitions per stretching exercise and session (β\,=\,0.023, p\,=\,0.004 and β\,=\,0.013, p\,=\,0.008, respectively), with more repetitions associated with larger muscle strength improvements. Muscle power was also moderated by mean age (β\,=\,0.006, p\,=\,0.007) with larger gains in older individuals. The meta-regression analysis indicated larger flexibility gains with more repetitions per session (β\,=\,0.094, p\,=\,0.016), more time under stretching per session (β\,=\,0.090, p\,=\,0.026), and more total time under stretching (β\,=\,0.078, p\,=\,0.034). Conclusions\enspace{} The main findings indicated that chronic SS exercises have the potential to improve muscle strength and power. Such improvements appear to benefit sedentary more than recreationally active participants. Likewise, chronic SS exercises result in a marked enhancement in flexibility with larger effects of passive, as compared with active, SS. The results of the meta-regression analysis for muscle strength indicated larger benefits of chronic SS exercises in samples with higher proportions of female, older participants, and a higher number of repetitions per stretching exercise and session. For muscle power, results suggested larger gains for older participants. Regarding flexibility, findings indicated larger benefits following a higher number of repetitions per exercise and a longer time under stretching per session as well as a longer total time under stretching.},

  abstract = {Background                                Breathing pure oxygen causes nitrogen washout from tissues, a method commonly deployed to prevent decompression sickness from hypobaric exposure. Theoretically prebreathing oxygen increases the capacity for nitrogen uptake and potentially limits supersaturation during dives of short duration. We aimed to use                 13                 N                 2                 , a radioactive nitrogen isotope, to quantify tissue nitrogen following normobaric and hyperbaric exposures.                                                        Methods                                Twenty Sprague Dawley rats were divided in 4 conditions; normobaric prebreathe, normobaric control, hyperbaric prebreathe, hyperbaric control. Prebreathed rats breathed oxygen for 1 h prior to the experiment whilst controls breathed air. Normobaric rats breathed air containing                 13                 N                 2                 at 100 kPa for 30 min, whereas hyperbaric rats breathed                 13                 N                 2                 at 700 kPa before being decompressed and sedated using air-isoflurane (without                 13                 N                 2                 for a few minutes). After euthanization, blood, brain, liver, femur and thigh muscle were analyzed by gamma counting.                                                        Results               At normobaria prebreathing oxygen resulted in higher absolute nitrogen counts in blood (p = .034), as well as higher normalized counts in both the liver and muscle (p = .034). However, following hyperbaric exposure no differences were observed between conditions for any organ (p{$>$}.344). Both bone and muscle showed higher normalized counts after hyperbaria compared to normobaria.                                         Conclusions                                Oxygen prebreathing caused nitrogen elimination in normobaria that led to a larger “sink” and uptake of                 13                 N                 2                 . The lack of difference between conditions in hyperbaria could be due to the duration and depth of the dive mitigating the effect of prebreathing. In the hyperbaric conditions the lower counts were likely due to off-gassing of nitrogen during the sedation procedure, suggest a few minutes was enough to off-gas in rodents. The higher normalized counts under hyperbaria in bone and muscle likely relate to these tissues being slower to on and off-gas nitrogen. Future experiments could include shorter dives and euthanization while breathing                 13                 N                 2                 to prevent off-gassing.},

  abstract = {In this paper of the special issue dedicated for the Olympics 2020, we put the light on an exciting facet of exercise-oncology, which may still be unknown to some audience. Accumulating convincing evidences show that exercise reduces cancer progression and recurrence mainly in colon and breast cancer patients. Interestingly, the positive effects of exercise on cancer outcomes were mainly observed when patients practiced vigorous exercise of 6 METs or more. At the molecular level, experimental studies highlighted that regular vigorous exercise could reduce tumor growth by driving changes in immune system, metabolism, hormones, systemic inflammation, angiogenesis and redox status. In the present review, we describe the main redox-sensitive mechanisms mediated by exercise. These redox mechanisms are of particular therapeutic interest as they may explain the emerging preclinical findings proving that the association of vigorous exercise with chemotherapy or radiotherapy improves the anti-cancer responses of both interventions. Clinical and preclinical studies converge to support the practice of exercise as an adjuvant therapy that improves cancer outcomes. The understanding of the underpinning molecular mechanisms of exercise in cancer can open new avenues to improve cancer care in patients. © 2020},

  abstract = {Regular physical activity (PA) improves cognitive functions, prevents brain atrophy, and delays the onset of cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. Presently, there are no specific recommendations for PA producing positive effects on brain health and little is known on its mediators. PA affects production and release of several peptides secreted from peripheral and central tissues, targeting receptors located in the central nervous system (CNS). This review will provide a summary of the current knowledge on the association between PA and cognition with a focus on the role of (neuro)peptides. For the review we define peptides as molecules with less than 100 amino acids and exclude myokines. Tachykinins, somatostatin, and opioid peptides were excluded from this review since they were not affected by PA. There is evidence suggesting that PA increases peripheral insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and elevated serum IGF-1 levels are associated with improved cognitive performance. It is therefore likely that IGF-1 plays a role in PA induced improvement of cognition. Other neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), ghrelin, galanin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) could mediate the beneficial effects of PA on cognition, but the current literature regarding these (neuro)peptides is limited. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract = {As human life expectancy increases, cognitive decline and memory impairment threaten independence and quality of life. Therefore, finding prevention and treatment strategies for memory impairment is an important health concern. Moreover, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved underlying memory preservation will enable the development of appropriate pharmaceuticals drugs for those who are activity limited. Exercise training as a non-pharmacological tool, has been known to increase the mean lifespan by maintaining general body health and improving the cardiovascular and nervous systems function. Among different exercise training protocols, aerobic exercise has been reported to prevent the progression of memory decline, provided adequate exertion level, duration, and frequency. Mechanisms underlying exercise training effects on memory performance have not been understood yet. Convergent evidence suggest several direct and indirect mechanisms at molecular and supramolecular levels. The supramolecular level includes improvement in blood circulation, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis which are under controls of complex molecular signaling of neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, exerkines, and epigenetics factors. Among these various factors, irisin/BDNF signaling seems to be one of the important mediators of crosstalk between contracted skeletal muscles and the brain during exercise training. This review provides an affordable and effective method to improve cognitive function in old ages, particularly those who are most vulnerable to neurodegenerative disorders.

High Alt Med Biol 18:73-79, 2017.-Hypoxic cerebral vasodilation is a highly conserved physiological response coupling cerebral O2 delivery (CDO2) to metabolic demand with increasingly important roles identified for the red blood cell (sensor) and nitric oxide (effector). In the current article, we reexamine previously published cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial blood gas data obtained in freedivers and mountaineers, extreme athletes in whom the lowest arterial partial pressures of O2 (19-23 mmHg) and greatest extremes of carbon dioxide (16-61 mmHg) were recorded during (acute) maximal static dry apnea or (chronic) exposure to terrestrial high altitude. Data highlight compensatory increases in CBF (+96\% in freedivers to +209\% in mountaineers relative to normoxic baseline controls) that were sufficient to sustain CDO2 (+24\% in freedivers to +183\% in mountaineers) even in the face of the most severe reductions in arterial O2 content (-61\% in freedivers to -9\% in mountaineers) reported in the literature, consistent with the conservation of mass principle. These unique findings highlight to what extent cerebral vasodilation likely contributes toward these athletes' extraordinary abilities to survive in such harsh environments characterized by physiological extremes of hypoxemia, alkalosis, and acidosis helping define the human brain's remarkable limits of tolerance.},

  abstract = {Obesity management for achieving an effective weight loss includes dietary modification and exercise [resistance (strength), endurance (cardiovascular) or intervals training (high-intensity intermittent exercise)]. Regular exercise acutely increases fat oxidation, which induces loss of fat mass and increases energy expenditure. Moreover, it has a positive effect on the physical (improved insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, etc.) and mental health (mood, cognition, memory, sleep, etc.). Endocrine responses to muscle actions are affected by many factors, including the exercise muscle groups (lower and upper body), load/volume, time-under tension, and rest-period intervals between sets, training status, gender, and age. The aim of this review is to summarize, evaluate, and clarify the literature data focusing on the endocrine responses to different types of exercise, including the frequency, intensity, and type of movement with regard to the fat loss strategies. Many studies have investigated anabolic [growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), testosterone] and gluco- and appetite- regulatory (insulin, cortisol, ghrelin) hormone responses and adaptations of skeletal muscles to exercise. Muscle tissue is a critical endocrine organ, playing important role in the regulation of several physiological and metabolic events. Moreover, we are also describing the response of some other substances to exercise, such as myokines [irisin, apelin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), myostatin, and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)]. It is proposed that reducing intra-abdominal fat mass and increasing cardiorespiratory fitness through improving nutritional quality, reducing sedentary behavior, and increase the participation in physical activity/exercise, might be associated with clinical benefits, sometimes even in the absence of weight loss. © 2015, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology.

Considering the consequences of advocating the early specialization ap- proach and research suggesting the effectiveness of early diversification, coaches and sport scientists should consider the early diversification approach as an alternative. Further research is required to expand our understanding of the relative contributions of diversified versus specialized training.

  abstract = {in the last years, scientists have shown that skeletal muscle is not a pure locomotor unit or responsible for propulsion and posture. Skeletal muscle encompasses one of the major organs of the body (constituting about 40\% of the body mass in non-obese men). it regulates energy and metabolic processes and is now recognized as an organ capable of producing molecules with vital functions. These molecules are termed myokines, a new field of research in the health sciences, and represent an open field of discoveries and applications in several areas. The aim of this review was to show the role of some well-known myokines in the maintenance of homeostasis. our search was performed in databases such as Medline/Pubmed, Embase and Scielo. Some relevant myokines are interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-15, irisin, myostatin, fibroblast growth factor 21 (fGf21), leukemia inhibitory factor (lif), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BdNf), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (iGf-1). They are related to play a positive or negative role in muscle function and metabolism homeostasis. They are associated with the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, the deposition of fat in the adipose tissue, and the “browning” of the white adipose tissue. for these reasons, they can interfere with the prevention of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. The discovery of the myokines has opened a new direction in understanding the effects of exercises on humans. © 2020 ediZioNi MiNerVa Medica},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle is capable of secreting different factors in order to communicate with other tissues. These mediators, the myokines, show potentially far-reaching effects on non-muscle tissues and can provide a molecular interaction between muscle and body physiology. Sarcopenia is a chronic degenerative neuromuscular disease closely related to cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure, which influences the production and release of myokines. Our objective was to explore the relationship between myokines, sarcopenia, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine actions of myokines include regulation of energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, lipolysis, free fatty acid oxidation, adipocyte browning, glycogenolysis, glycogenesis, and general metabolism. A sedentary lifestyle accelerates the aging process and is a risk factor for developing sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome, and CVD. Increased adipose tissue resulting from the decrease in muscle mass in patients with sarcopenia may also be involved in the pathology of CVD. Myokines are protagonists in the complex condition of sarcopenia, which is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with CVD. The discovery of new pathways and the link between myokines and CVD remain a cornerstone toward multifaceted interventions and perhaps the minimization of the damage resulting from muscle loss induced by factors such as atherosclerosis. © 2020 by the authors.},

Interorgan communication via muscle-secreted factors therefore provides a novel area for investigation and implicates the importance of skeletal muscle in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). Given that underlying molecular mechanisms of T2D are subject of ongoing research, in light of new evidence it is probable that interorgan cross-talk between skeletal muscle and pancreatic β -cells plays an important part. To date, the number of studies published in this field provide the basis of this review. Specifically, we discuss current experimental evidence in support for a role of skeletal muscle to β -cell cross-talk, paying particular attention to muscle-secreted factors including myokines, metabolites, miRNAs, and factors contained within exosomes that influence the function and/or the survival of β -cells in health and disease. In reviewing this evidence, we provide an update on the list of known muscle-secreted factors that have potential to influence the function and/or survival of β -cells under normal and diabetic conditions. We also report limitations of current cross-talk methods and discuss future directions in this growing field. © 2018 American Physiological Society. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Clinical Scenario: Kinesiophobia is a common psychological phenomenon that occurs following injury involving fear of movement. These psychological factors contribute to the variability among patients' perceived disability scores following injury. In addition, the psychophysiological, behavioral, and cognitive factors of kinesiophobia have been shown to be predictive of a patient's self-reported disability and pain. Previous kinesiophobia research has mostly focused on lower-extremity injuries. There are fewer studies that investigate upper-extremity injuries despite the influence that upper-extremity injuries can have on an individual's activities of daily living and, therefore, disability scores. The lack of research calls for a critical evaluation and appraisal of available evidence regarding kinesiophobia and its contribution to perceived disability for the upper-extremity. Focused Clinical Question: How does kinesiophobia in patients with upper-extremity injuries influence perceptions of disability and quality of life measurements? Summary of Key Findings: Two cross-sectional studies and one cohort study were included. The first study found a positive relationship between kinesiophobia and a high degree of perceived disability. Another study found that kinesiophobia and catastrophic thinking scores were the most important predictors of perceived upper-extremity disability. The third study found that kinesiophobia contributes to self-reported disability in the shoulder. Clinical Bottom Line: There is moderate evidence that supports the relationship between kinesiophobia and perceived disability, and the relationship between elevated perceptions of disability and increased kinesiophobia scores in patients with an upper-extremity injury. Clinicians should evaluate and monitor kinesiophobia in patients following injury, a condition that can enhance perceptions of disability. An elevated perception of disability can create a cycle of fear that leads to hypervigilance and fear-avoidance behavior. Strength of Recommendation: Consistent findings from reviewed studies suggest there is grade B evidence to support that kinesiophobia is related to an increased perceived disability following upper-extremity injuries.},

A chamber study was performed to compare effects of rapid (RD) vs. gradual decompression and gauge impairment at altitude with and without hypoxia, as well as to assess recovery.                METHODS:                There were 12 participants who completed RD (1\,s) and Gradual (3\,min 12\,s) ascents from 2743–7620\,m (9000–25000\,ft) altitude pressures while breathing air or 100\% O                2                . Physiological indices included oxygen saturation (S                P                o                2                ),   heart rate (HR), respiration, end tidal O                2                and CO                2                partial pressures, and electroencephalography (EEG). Cognition was evaluated using SYNWIN, which combines memory, arithmetic, visual, and auditory tasks. The study incorporated ascent rate (RD, gradual), breathing gas   (air, 100\% O                2                ) and epoch (ground-level, pre-breathe, ascent-altitude, recovery) as factors.                RESULTS:                Physiological effects in hypoxic “air” ascents included decreased S                P                o                2                and end tidal O                2                and CO                2                partial pressures   (hypocapnia), with elevated HR and minute ventilation ({$<$}mml:math id="im1" display="inline"{$><$}mml:mrow{$><$}mml:mover{$><$}mml:mtext{$>$}V{$<$}/mml:mtext{$><$}mml:mo{$>$}˙{$<$}/mml:mo{$><$}/mml:mover{$><$}/mml:mrow{$><$}/mml:math{$>$}                E                ); S                P                o                2                and HR effects were greater after RD (−7.3\% lower and +10.0 bpm higher, respectively).

  abstract = {In recent years there has been a strong increase in publications on blood flow restriction (BFR) training. In particular, the fact that this type of training requires only low resistance to induce muscle strength and mass gains, makes BFR training interesting for athletes and scientists alike. For the same reason this type of training is particularly interesting for astronauts working out in space. Lower resistance during training would have the advantage of reducing the risk of strain-induced injuries. Furthermore, strength training with lower resistances would have implications for the equipment required for training under microgravity conditions, as significantly lower resistances have to be provided by the training machines. Even though we are only about to understand the effects of blood flow restriction on exercise types other than low-intensity strength training, the available data indicate that BFR of leg muscles is also able to improve the training effects of walking or running at slow speeds. The underlying mechanisms of BFR-induced functional and structural adaptations are still unclear. An essential aspect seems to be the premature fatigue of Type-I muscle fibers, which requires premature recruitment of Type-II muscle fibers to maintain a given force output. Other theories assume that cell swelling, anabolic hormones, myokines and reactive oxygen species are involved in the mediation of BFR training-related effects. This review article is intended to summarize the main advantages and disadvantages, but also the potential risks of such training for astronauts. Copyright © 2019 Behringer and Willberg.

  abstract = {Adult skeletal tissue is composed of heterogeneous population of cells that constantly self-renew by means of a controlled process of activation and proliferation of tissue-resident stem cells named satellite cells. Many growth factors, cytokines and myokines produced by skeletal muscle cells play critical roles in local regulation of the inflammatory process and skeletal muscle regeneration during different pathological conditions. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine released in large amount during infection, autoimmunity and cancer. Low levels of IL-6 can promote activation of satellite cells and myotube regeneration while chronically elevated production promote skeletal muscle wasting. These distinct effects may be explained by a crosstalk of the IL-6/IL-6 receptor and gp130 trans-signaling pathway that oppose to regenerative and anti-inflammatory of the classical IL-6 receptor signaling pathway. Here we discuss on potential therapeutic strategies using monoclonal antibodies to IL-6R for the treatment of skeletal muscle wasting and cachexia. We also highlight on the IL-6/JAK/STAT and FGF/p38αβ MAPK signaling pathways in satellite cell activation and the use of protein kinase inhibitors for tailoring and optimizing satellite cell proliferation during the skeletal muscle renewal. Future investigations on the roles of the IL-6 classical and trans-signaling pathways in both immune and non-immune cells in skeletal muscle tissue will provide new basis for therapeutic approaches to reverse atrophy and degeneration of skeletal muscles in cancer and inflammatory diseases. © 2016, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The connection between physical exercise and the brain has long been studied. The evidence showing that physical exercise plays a significant role on neurogenesis and cognitive function has primarily been based on research examining aerobic exercise. In this review, we described three exercise modalities: aerobic, anaerobic, and resistance exercise and their impact on brain plasticity and cognitive function. While each of these exercise modalities have been demonstrated to positively influence brain plasticity and cognitive function, the specific mechanism that stimulates these changes appear to differ to some degree between these training modalities. The effect of aerobic and anaerobic exercise appears to be primarily mediated by changes in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), lactate, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and several additional proteins within the brain. However, resistance exercise appears to influence brain plasticity by myokines such as irisin, insulin-growth factor-1 (IGF1), and BDNF that are secreted from skeletal tissue and stimulate neurogenesis within the brain. In addition to the various training modes, manipulation of various acute program variables such as intensity, volume, and rest intervals leads to numerous possible training paradigms that can provide a different stimulus for neurogenesis. This review focuses on the three primary training modes and their connection to neurogenesis and cognitive function. © 2022 Israel Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Persistent systemic inflammation, a typical feature of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, is associated with a high cardiovascular risk and predisposes to metabolic disorders and muscle wasting. These disorders can lead to disability and decreased physical activity, exacerbating inflammation and the development of a network of chronic diseases, thus establishing a 'vicious cycle' of chronic inflammation. During the past two decades, advances in research have shed light on the role of exercise as a therapy for rheumatic diseases. One of the most important of these advances is the discovery that skeletal muscle communicates with other organs by secreting proteins called myokines. Some myokines are thought to induce anti-inflammatory responses with each bout of exercise and mediate long-term exercise-induced improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, having an indirect anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, contrary to fears that physical activity might aggravate inflammatory pathways, exercise is now believed to be a potential treatment for patients with rheumatic diseases. In this Review, we discuss how exercise disrupts the vicious cycle of chronic inflammation directly, after each bout of exercise, and indirectly, by improving comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. We also discuss the mechanisms by which some myokines have anti-inflammatory functions in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is a global medical problem that characterizes poor prognosis and high economic burden for the health system and family of the HF patients. Although modern treatment approaches have significantly decreased a risk of the occurrence of HF among patients having predominant coronary artery disease, hypertension, and myocarditis, the mortality of known HF continues to be unacceptably high. One of the most important symptoms of HF that negatively influences tolerance to physical exercise, well-being, social adaptation, and quality of life is deep fatigue due to HF-related myopathy. Myopathy in HF is associated with weakness of the skeletal muscles, loss of myofibers, and the development of fibrosis due to microvascular inflammation, metabolic disorders, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The pivotal role in the regulation of myocardial and skeletal muscle rejuvenation, attenuation of muscle metabolic homeostasis, and protection against ischemia injury and apoptosis belongs to myokines. Myokines are defined as a wide spectrum of active molecules that are directly synthesized and released by both cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes and regulate energy homeostasis in autocrine/paracrine manner. In addition, myokines have a large spectrum of pleiotropic capabilities that are involved in the pathogenesis of HF including cardiac remodeling, muscle atrophy, and cardiac cachexia. The aim of the narrative review is to summarize the knowledge with respect to the role of myokines in adverse cardiac remodeling, myopathy, and clinical outcomes among HF patients. Some myokines, such as myostatin, irisin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin-15, fibroblast growth factor-21, and growth differential factor-11, being engaged in the regulation of the pathogenesis of HF-related myopathy, can be detected in peripheral blood, and the evaluation of their circulating levels can provide new insights to the course of HF and stratify patients at higher risk of poor outcomes prior to sarcopenic stage. © 2021 Alexander E.

  abstract = {Bone fractures in older adults are often preceded by a loss of muscle mass and strength. Likewise, bone loss with prolonged bed rest, spinal cord injury, or with exposure to microgravity is also preceded by a rapid loss of muscle mass. Recent studies using animal models in the setting of hindlimb unloading or botulinum toxin (Botox) injection also reveal that muscle loss can induce bone loss. Moreover, muscle-derived factors such as irisin and leptin can inhibit bone loss with unloading, and knockout of catabolic factors in muscle such as the ubiquitin ligase Murf1 or the myokine myostatin can reduce osteoclastogenesis. These findings suggest that therapies targeting muscle in the setting of disuse atrophy may potentially attenuate bone loss, primarily by reducing bone resorption. These potential therapies not only include pharmacological approaches but also interventions such as whole-body vibration coupled with resistance exercise and functional electric stimulation of muscle. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.},

  abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Up to one third of individuals with NAFLD will develop nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with progression to cirrhosis and is rapidly becoming the leading indication for liver transplantation. Sarcopenia is defined as a progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function. It is observed in up to 60\% of patients with end-stage liver disease and portends a poor prognosis. Recent studies have shown that sarcopenia is a novel risk factor for developing NAFLD. Pathophysiological mechanisms relating sarcopenia and NASH may include insulin resistance (IR) and increased inflammation. IR leads to accumulation of triglycerides in both muscle tissue and the liver. It also exacerbates proteolysis and leads to muscle depletion. Chronic inflammation leads to liver injury and progression of fibrosis. The inflammatory milieu also stimulates protein catabolism. Viewing skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ that secretes various salutary myokines may help us understand its role in the development of steatosis. A better understanding of the pathophysiology will aid in developing physical and pharmacological therapeutic interventions. In this review, we will explore the complex inter-relationships between sarcopenia and NASH. We will discuss the impact of sarcopenia in patients with NASH and therapeutic options for the management of sarcopenia.

However, brief profound hypoxia (here defined as Sao2 50\%–70\% for approximately 10 minutes) is not associated with cardiovascular compromise and is tolerated by healthy humans without apparent ill effects. In contrast, chronic hypoxia induces a suite of adaptations and stresses that can result in either increased tolerance of hypoxia or disease, as in adaptation to altitude or in the syndrome of chronic mountain sickness. In healthy humans, brief profound hypoxia produces increased minute ventilation and increased cardiac output, but little or no alteration in blood chemistry. Central nervous system effects of acute profound hypoxia include transiently decreased cognitive performance, based on alterations in attention brought about by interruptions of frontal/central cerebral connectivity. However, provided there is no decrease in cardiac output or ischemia, brief profound hypoxemia in healthy humans is well tolerated without evidence of acidosis or lasting cognitive impairment.},

In the 1940s, Glenn Allen Millikan developed an ear oximeter to estimate hemoglobin saturation for determination of when high-altitude World War II fighter and bomber pilots required supplemental oxygen.1 The Millikan oximeter required cumbersome calibration and so remained a research device for the next 30 yr. It was the ingenious observation of Takou Aoyagi in 1974 that the arterial signal could be obtained without calibration, if you assume that the only pulsatile absorber in the tissue is the pulsing arterial blood. Aoyagi’s pulse oximeter involved a relatively simple device of light-emitting diodes and photodiode detectors and used the pulsatile absorbance signal to estimate arterial hemoglobin saturation. Once an empiric calibration for this approach was established for human subjects in controlled laboratory hypoxia conditions, no further calibration of pulse oximeters is needed. For the most part, the device today is the same as the original pulse oximeters of the 1980s.},

  abstract = {The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are defined as idiopathic, chronic and relapsing intestinal disorders occurring in genetically predisposed individuals exposed to environmental risk factors such as diet and microbiome changes. Since conventional drug therapy is expensive and not fully efficient, there is a need for alternative remedies that can improve the outcome in patients suffering from IBD. Whether exercise, which has been proposed as adjunct therapy in IBD, can be beneficial in patients with IBD remains an intriguing question. In this review, we provide an overview of the effects of exercise on human IBD and experimental colitis in animal models that mimic human disease, although the information on exercise in human IBD are sparse and poorly understood. Moderate exercise can exert a beneficial ameliorating effect on IBD and improve the healing of experimental animal colitis due to the activity of protective myokines such as irisin released from working skeletal muscles. CD patients with higher levels of exercise were significantly less likely to develop active disease at six months. Moreover, voluntary exercise has been shown to exert a positive effect on IBD patients' mood, weight maintenance and osteoporosis. On the other hand, depending on its intensity and duration, exercise can evoke transient mild systemic inflammation and enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine release, thereby exacerbating the gastrointestinal symptoms. We discuss recent advances in the mechanism of voluntary and strenuous exercise affecting the outcome of IBD in patients and experimental animal models. © 2016 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.},

  abstract = {Background: Physical activity can be involved in the prevention of gastrointestinal (GI)-tract diseases, however, the results regarding the volume and the intensity of exercise considered as beneficial for protection of gastrointestinal organs are conflicting. Aims and Methods: The main objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive and updated overview on the beneficial and harmful effects of physical activity on the gastrointestinal tract. We attempted to discuss recent evidence regarding the association between different modes and intensity levels of exercise and physiological functions of the gut and gut pathology. Results: The regular, moderate exercise can exert a beneficial effect on GI-tract disorders such as reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcers, cholelithiasis, constipation and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) leading to the attenuation of the symptoms. This voluntary exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that the high-intensity training or prolonged endurance training can exert a negative influence on GI-tract resulting in the exacerbation of symptoms. Conclusion: Physical activity can exhibit a beneficial effect on a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, however, this effect depends upon the exercise mode, duration and intensity. The accumulated evidence indicate that management of gastrointestinal problems and their relief by the exercise seems to be complicated and require adjustments of physical activity training, dietary measures and medical monitoring of symptoms. More experimental and clinical studies on the effects of physical activity on GI-tract disorders are warranted. Especially, the association between the exercise intensity and data addressing the underlying mechanism(s) of the exercise as the complementary therapy in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, require further determination in animal models and humans. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) characterized by a cyclical nature, which alternates between active and quiescent states, ultimately impairing a patients' quality of life. The etiology of IBD is not known but it likely involves a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors. Physical exercise has been suggested to provide protection against the onset of IBD, but there are inconsistencies in the findings of the published literature. Current research recommends exercise to help counteract some IBD-specific complications and preliminary studies suggest that physical activity may be beneficial in reducing the symptoms of IBD. Obesity is becoming more prevalent in patients diagnosed with IBD and may be associated with higher disease activity. There is evidence that adipokines are involved in the inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Hypertrophy of the mesenteric white adipose tissue has been long recognized as a characteristic feature of Crohn's disease; however its importance is unknown. Recent data suggest that dysregulation of adipokine secretion by white adipose tissue is involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Skeletal muscle was shown to produce biologically active myokines, which could be a important contributor to the beneficial effects of exercise. There is mounting evidence for the bi-directional endocrine cross talk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The objective of the present review is to explore the role of exercise and its impact on IBD. Also, we discuss how current discoveries regarding the importance of adipokines and myokines and their cross talk expand our view of the pathological changes and the therapeutic options for IBD.},

  abstract = {Obesity and ageing place a tremendous strain on the global healthcare system. Age-related sarcopenia is characterized by decreased muscular strength, decreased muscle quantity, quality, and decreased functional performance. Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is a condition that combines sarcopenia and obesity and has a substantial influence on the older adults’ health. Because of the complicated pathophysiology, there are disagreements and challenges in identifying and diagnosing SO. Recently, it has become clear that dysbiosis may play a role in the onset and progression of sarcopenia and SO. Skeletal muscle secretes myokines during contraction, which play an important role in controlling muscle growth, function, and metabolic balance. Myokine dysfunction can cause and aggravate obesity, sarcopenia, and SO. The only ways to prevent and slow the progression of sarcopenia, particularly sarcopenic obesity, are physical activity and correct nutritional support. While exercise cannot completely prevent sarcopenia and age-related loss in muscular function, it can certainly delay development and slow down the rate of sarcopenia. The purpose of this review was to discuss potential pathways to muscle deterioration in obese individuals. We also want to present the current understanding of the role of various factors, including microbiota and myokines, in the process of sarcopenia and SO. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a group of disorders which include ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Obesity is becoming increasingly more common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease and plays a role in the development and course of the disease. This is especially true in the case of Crohn’s disease. The recent results indicate a special role of visceral adipose tissue and particularly mesenteric adipose tissue, also known as “creeping fat”, in pathomechanism, leading to intestinal inflammation. The involvement of altered adipocyte function and the deregulated production of adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, has been suggested in pathogenesis of IBD. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of obesity in IBD, the influence of a Western diet on the course of Crohn’s disease and colitis in IBD patients and animal’s models, and the potential role of adipokines in these disorders. Since altered body composition, decrease of skeletal muscle mass, and development of pathologically changed mesenteric white adipose tissue are well-known features of IBD and especially of Crohn’s disease, we discuss the possible crosstalk between adipokines and myokines released from skeletal muscle during exercise with moderate or forced intensity. The emerging role of microbiota and the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory enzymes such as intestinal alkaline phosphatase is also discussed, in order to open new avenues for the therapy against intestinal perturbations associated with IBD. © 2019 by the authors.

  abstract = {Both obesity and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) rates have increased sharply in the United States and Western Europe in recent years. EAC is a classic example of obesity-related cancer where the risk of EAC increases with increasing body mass index. Pathologically altered visceral fat in obesity appears to play a key role in this process. Visceral obesity may promote EAC by directly affecting gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett’s esophagus (BE), as well as a less reflux-dependent effect, including the release of pro-inflammatory adipokines and insulin resistance. Deregulation of adipokine production, such as the shift to an increased amount of leptin relative to “protective” adiponectin, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of BE and EAC. This review discusses not only the epidemiology and pathophysiology of obesity in BE and EAC, but also molecular alterations at the level of mRNA and proteins associated with these esophageal pathologies and the potential role of adipokines and myokines in these disorders. Particular attention is given to discussing the possible crosstalk of adipokines and myokines during exercise. It is concluded that lifestyle interventions to increase regular physical activity could be helpful as a promising strategy for preventing the development of BE and EAC. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract = {We reviewed and analyzed the relationship between physical exercise and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which covers a group of chronic, relapsing, and remitting intestinal disorders including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis. The etiology of IBD likely involves a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors. Physical training has been suggested to be protective against the onset of IBD, but there are inconsistencies in the findings of the published literature. Hypertrophy of the mesenteric white adipose tissue (mWAT) is recognized as a characteristic feature of CD, but its importance for the perpetuation of onset of this intestinal disease is unknown. Adipocytes synthesize proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Hypertrophy of mWAT could play a role as a barrier to the inflammatory process, but recent data suggest that deregulation of adipokine secretion is involved in the pathogenesis of CD. Adipocytokines and macrophage mediators perpetuate the intestinal inflammatory process, leading to mucosal ulcerations along the mesenteric border, a typical feature of CD. Contracting skeletal muscles release biologically active myokines, known to exert the direct anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibit the release of proinflammatory mediators from visceral fat. Further research is required to confirm these observations and establish exercise regimes for IBD patients. © 2014 Jan Bilski et al.},

In this paper, the roles of the various adipose tissues in obesity are summarized, with particular focus on mitochondrial function.

  abstract = {Obesity is a global epidemic, accompanied by increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue hypertrophy is associated with adipose tissue inflammation, which alters the secretion of adipose tissue-derived bioactive products, known as adipokines. Adipokines determine vessel wall properties such as smooth muscle tone and vessel wall inflammation. Exercise is a mainstay of prevention of chronic, non-communicable diseases, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in particular. Aside from reducing adipose tissue mass, exercise has been shown to reduce inflammatory activity in this tissue. Mechanistically, contracting muscles release bioactive molecules known as myokines, which alter the metabolic phenotype of adipose tissue. In adipose tissue, myokines induce browning, enhance fatty acid oxidation and improve insulin sensitivity. In the past years, the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) which surrounds the vasculature, has been shown to control vascular tone and inflammation through local release of adipokines. In obesity, an increase in mass and inflammation of PVAT culminate in dysregulation of adipokine secretion, which contributes to vascular dysfunction. This review describes our current understanding of the mechanisms by which active muscles interact with adipose tissue and improve vascular function. Aside from the exercise-dependent regulation of canonical adipose tissue function, we will focus on the interactions between skeletal muscle and PVAT and the role of novel myokines, such as IL-15, FGF21 and irisin, in these interactions.

There were 1.95 direct catastrophic injuries per year or 0.6 injuries per 100,000 participants. The rate of injuries among college cheerleaders was five times that of high school participants. The most common stunts performed at the time of injury were a pyramid (9) or a basket toss (8). Catastrophic injuries included 17 severe head injuries, resulting in 13 skull fractures and 2 deaths; 8 cervical fractures or major ligament injuries; 3 spinal cord contusions; and 1 concomitant head injury and cervical fracture.Conclusions: Suggestions for reducing catastrophic injuries in cheerleaders include enhancing the number and training of spotters, mandating floor mats for complex stunts, restricting complex stunts when surfaces are wet, and encouraging safety certification of coaches. Pyramids and basket tosses should be limited to experienced cheerleaders who have mastered all other skills and should be performed with spotters and landing mats.},

Far from being the "passive placeholder in bone," this cell has been found to have numerous functions, such as acting as an orchestrator of bone remodeling through regulation of both osteoclast and osteoblast activity and also functioning as an endocrine cell. The osteocyte is a source of soluble factors not only to target cells on the bone surface but also to target distant organs, such as kidney, muscle, and other tissues. This cell plays a role in both phosphate metabolism and calcium availability and can remodel its perilacunar matrix. Osteocytes compose 90\% to 95\% of all bone cells in adult bone and are the longest lived bone cell, up to decades within their mineralized environment. As we age, these cells die, leaving behind empty lacunae that frequently micropetrose. In aged bone such as osteonecrotic bone, empty lacunae are associated with reduced remodeling. Inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor and glucocorticoids used to treat inflammatory disease induce osteocyte cell death, but by different mechanisms with potentially different outcomes. Therefore, healthy, viable osteocytes are necessary for proper functionality of bone and other organs.},

Therefore, I deemed it would be instructive for future generations to consider one facet of his 54-year career - human exercise models. I arbitrarily selected to share five examples of new paradigm models initiated by Saltin. They are: bed rest; arms vs legs; one leg vs the other leg; myokine communication from skeletal muscle to other organs/tissues; and 42-day cross-country skiing expedition. I~arbitrarily selected the above as examples of novel approaches that he used to the study humans during maximal endurance exercise. Noteworthy though is that Saltin's lifetime demeanor, itself, is a model for other scientists. In final analysis, the world is richer due to his passion to study humans to advance medical science by uncovering mechanisms as to how the human body is constructed to perform endurance types of exercise at maximal intensities and durations. © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.},

  abstract = {This review proposes that physical inactivity could be considered a behavior selected by evolution for resting, and also selected to be reinforcing in life-threatening situations in which exercise would be dangerous. Underlying the notion are human twin studies and animal selective breeding studies, both of which provide indirect evidence for the existence of genes for physical inactivity. Approximately 86\% of the 325 million in the United States (U.S.) population achieve less than the U.S. Government and World Health Organization guidelines for daily physical activity for health. Although underappreciated, physical inactivity is an actual contributing cause to at least 35 unhealthy conditions, including the majority of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. First, we introduce nine physical inactivity-related themes. Next, characteristics and models of physical inactivity are presented. Following next are individual examples of phenotypes, organ systems, and diseases that are impacted by physical inactivity, including behavior, central nervous system, cardiorespiratory fitness, metabolism, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, bone, immunity, digestion, and cancer. Importantly, physical inactivity, itself, often plays an independent role as a direct cause of speeding the losses of cardiovascular and strength fitness, shortening of healthspan, and lowering of the age for the onset of the first chronic disease, which in turn decreases quality of life, increases health care costs, and accelerates mortality risk. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.}

  abstract = {Skeletal muscles and bone tissue form the musculoskeletal apparatus, a complex system essential for the voluntary movement. The loss of muscle mass and muscle strength is often associated with a loss of bone mass, in a “hazardous duet” which implies the co-existence of sarcopenia-osteoporosis and exposes patients to a deterioration in quality of life and increased mortality. From the mechanostat theory to the recent definition of the osteosarcopenia syndrome, many aspects of muscle-bone interaction have been investigated in recent decades. The mechanical interaction is now accepted, considering the close anatomical relationship between the two tissues, however, much remains to be discovered regarding the biochemical muscle-bone interaction. Skeletal muscle has been defined as an endocrine organ capable of exerting an action on other tissues. Myokines, bioactive polypeptides released by the muscle, could represent the encrypted message in the communication between muscle and bone. These two tissues have a reciprocal influence on their metabolisms and respond in a similar way to the multiple external factors. The aim of this review is to stimulate the understanding of the encrypted language between muscle and bone, highlighting the role of catabolic pathways and oxidative stress in the musculoskeletal apparatus to elucidate the shared mechanisms and the similarity of response to the same stimuli by different tissues. Our understanding of muscle-bone interactions it could be useful to identify and develop new strategies to treat musculoskeletal diseases, together with pharmacological, nutritional and exercise-based approaches, which are already in use for the treatment of these pathologies. © 2021},

However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and there is currently much focus on detailing such pathways. Traditionally, much emphasis has been placed on skeletal muscle; however, recently, nonmuscle organs such as adipose tissue have been highlighted in mediating protective actions after training. Moreover, novel paracrine- and endocrine-signaling molecules have been shown to trigger important responses in nonmuscle organs after exercise. This is exciting because, when administered exogenously, such signals have obvious therapeutic potential. In this review, the authors have described some general and historical aspects of training and disease protection.

  abstract = {Purpose of Review: In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the progressive skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction and degeneration is accompanied by low bone mineral density and bone fragility. Glucocorticoids, which remain the standard of care for patients with DMD, increase the risk of developing osteoporosis. The scope of this review emphasizes the mutual cohesion and common signaling pathways between bone and skeletal muscle in DMD. Recent Findings: The muscle-bone interactions involve bone-derived osteokines, muscle-derived myokines, and dual-origin cytokines that trigger common signaling pathways leading to fibrosis, inflammation, or protein synthesis/degradation. In particular, the triad RANK/RANKL/OPG including receptor activator of NF-kB (RANK), its ligand (RANKL), along with osteoprotegerin (OPG), regulates bone matrix modeling and remodeling pathways and contributes to muscle pathophysiology in DMD. Summary: This review discusses the importance of the muscle-bone unit in DMD and covers recent research aimed at determining the muscle-bone interactions that may eventually lead to the development of multifunctional and effective drugs for treating muscle and bone disorders regardless of the underlying genetic mutations in DMD. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Eighteen male university students (age, 24.3 ± 3.2 years; height, 181.5 ± 11.4 cm; body mass, 78.1 ± 6.4 kg; mean ± SD) completed 4 different conditions in a randomized order, on different days, interspersed by a minimum of 72 hours of rest. Each session consisted of a standard 5-minute cycle warm-up, accompanied by one of the subsequent conditions: (a) control, (b) 10-minute static stretching, (c) 10-minute ballistic stretching, or (d) 10-minute proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching. The subjects performed 3 trials of static and countermovement jumps prior to stretching and poststretching at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. Vertical jump height decreased after static and PNF stretching (4.0\% and 5.1\%, p {$<$} 0.05) and there was a smaller decrease after ballistic stretching (2.7\%, p {$>$} 0.05). However, jumping performance had fully recovered 15 minutes after all stretching conditions. In conclusion, vertical jump performance is diminished for 15 minutes if performed after static or PNF stretching, whereas ballistic stretching has little effect on jumping performance. Consequently, PNF or static stretching should not be performed immediately prior to an explosive athletic movement.},

Once familiarized, 16 experienced jumpers completed 2 testing sessions in a randomized order. Each session consisted of a general warm-up, a pretreatment CMVJ assessment, a treatment, and multiple posttreatment CMVJ assessments. One treatment included lower-body static stretching, and the second treatment, involving no stretching, was the control. Posttreatment CMVJ measures occurred immediately, 3, 6, 12, and 24 minutes posttreatment. Stretching consisted of 3 static-stretching exercises, with each exercise repeated 3 times and each repetition held for 30 s. Prestretch CMVJ height equaled 47.1 (+/- 9.7) cm. CMVJ height immediately poststretch was 45.7 (+/- 9.2) cm, and it remained depressed during the 24-min follow-up period. Pre-no-stretch CMVJ height was 48.4 (+/- 9.8) cm, whereas immediately post-no-stretch CMVJ height equaled 46.8 (+/- 9.5) cm, and as in the stretch treatment, post-no-stretch CMVJ height remained lower than pre-no-stretch values.Although there was a significant main effect of time (P = .005), indicating that CMVJ was lower and remained impaired after both treatments, no significant interaction effect (P = .749) was observed. In comparison with the no-activity control, static stretching resulted in similar reductions in CMVJ ability when examined over the same time course, so athletes preparing for CMVJ should avoid periods of inactivity, as well as static stretching.},

  abstract = {Chronic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, and tumour growth. Regular exercise offers protection against type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, colon cancer, breast cancer, and dementia. Evidence suggests that the protective effect of exercise may to some extent be ascribed to the antiinflammatory effect of regular exercise. Here we suggest that exercise may exert its anti-inflammatory effect via a reduction in visceral fat mass and/or by induction of an anti-inflammatory environment with each bout of exercise. According to our theory, such effects may in part be mediated via muscle-derived peptides, so-called “myokines”. Contracting skeletal muscles release myokines with endocrine effects, mediating direct anti-inflammatory effects, and/or specific effects on visceral fat. Other myokines work locally within the muscle and exert their effects on signalling pathways involved in fat oxidation and glucose uptake. By mediating anti-inflammatory effects in the muscle itself, myokines may also counteract TNF-driven insulin resistance. In conclusion, exercise-induced myokines appear to be involved in mediating both systemic as well as local anti-inflammatory effects.},

Several of these myokines influence metabolism, regeneration and/or hypertrophy and are therefore considered to be important contributing factors in muscle homeostasis and muscle adaptation to exercise training. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is produced and released from muscle cells in vitro and from intact skeletal muscle in vivo. During exercise, skeletal muscle potently up-regulates LIF mRNA expression, likely due to oscillations in intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations. However, circulating levels of LIF are not increased with exercise suggesting that LIF exerts its effect locally. LIF stimulates muscle satellite cell proliferation and is involved in muscle hypertrophy and regeneration. Thus, LIF may be produced by skeletal muscle during exercise to contribute to local aspects of muscle adaptation to exercise.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity increase production of vascular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which results in a reduction of bioavailable nitric oxide and ultimately endothelial dysfunction and endothelial cell activation. ROS appears to mediate the inflammatory pathways that participate in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. There are numerous markers of oxidative stress and inflammation available for assessing the therapeutic response to interventions, but few are currently recommended for clinical use. Exercise training improves endothelial function via several mechanisms, including increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase—nitric oxide (eNOS-NO)— mediated production, increased activity and amount of antioxidants, attenuated ROS production, and an apparent reduction in systemic inflammation, possibly related to an increase in myokines resulting from skeletal muscle activation. Dietary antioxidant supplementation may improve endothelial function, oxidative stress, and inflammation, but much controversy exists regarding the use of antioxidant supplementation in primary and secondary CVD prevention. The purpose of this article is to review the contribution of vascular oxidative stress and activation of the inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of CVD and to review common methods used in clinical research to assess vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in response to therapeutic lifestyle interventions. © 2010, SAGE Publications.

It makes sense from a historical point of view that the mechanical theories of musculoskeletal development have had tremendous influence of our understanding of biology, because these relationships are clear and palpable. Less visible to the naked eye or even to the microscope is the biochemical interaction among the individual players of the musculoskeletal system.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulse oximetry is used as an assessment tool to gauge the severity of COVID-19 infection and identify patients at risk of poor outcomes.1,2,3,4 The pandemic highlights the need for accurate pulse oximetry, particularly at home, as infection rates increase in multiple global regions including the UK, USA and South Africa5. Over 100 million Samsung smartphones containing dedicated biosensors (Maxim Integrated Inc, San Jose, CA) and preloaded Apps to perform pulse oximetry, are in use globally. We performed detailed in human hypoxia testing on the Samsung S9 smartphone to determine if this integrated hardware meets full FDA/ISO requirements for clinical pulse oximetry. METHODS: The accuracy of integrated pulse oximetry in the Samsung 9 smartphone during stable arterial oxygen saturations (SaO2) between 70\% and 100\% was evaluated in 12 healthy subjects. Inspired oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide partial pressures were monitored and adjusted via a partial rebreathing circuit to achieve stable target SaO2 plateaus between 70\% and 100\%. Arterial blood samples were taken at each plateau and saturation measured on each blood sample using ABL-90FLEX blood gas analyzer. Bias, calculated from smartphone readings minus the corresponding arterial blood sample, was reported as root mean square deviation (RMSD). FINDINGS: The RMSD of the over 257 data points based on blood sample analysis obtained from 12 human volunteers tested was 2.6\%. INTERPRETATION: Evaluation of the smartphone pulse oximeter performance is within requirements of {$<$}3.5\% RMSD blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) value for FDA/ISO clearance for clinical pulse oximetry. This is the first report of smartphone derived pulse oximetry measurements that meet full FDA/ISO accuracy certification requirements. Both Samsung S9 and S10 contain the same integrated pulse oximeter, thus over 100 million smartphones in current global circulation could be used to obtain clinically accurate spot SpO2 measurements to support at home assessment of COVID-19 patients.},

Methods We searched articles recording concurrent peri-ictal and ictal EEG and Sp02 in adults and children with epilepsy. Studies reporting the total number of seizures recorded and the number of seizures with IH were included in a random-effects meta-analysis. A random-effects meta-regression was used to identify variables affecting study heterogeneity. Results Twenty-one studies, including 917 participants and 1840 with SpO2 data available were included. The meta-analysis showed a pooled incidence of IH of 35/100 seizures (95\% CI 27–44). Sp02 desaturation threshold was associated with the incidence of IH, with less severe desaturations resulting in higher IH frequencies. The incidence of IH was 41/100 seizures (95\% CI 29–54) for adults and 47/100 seizures (95\% CI 15–78) for tonic-clonic seizures. The meta-regression showed that SpO2 desaturation severity was the sole variable significantly correlated with the incidence of ictal hypoxemia (p\,=\,0.00). Conclusion In a population with refractory epilepsy IH is a frequent phenomenon, especially in adults and in patients presenting with tonic-clonic seizures. The severity of IH appeared independent from the age group and from seizure type and is probably the major clinical concern for its correlation with potentially life-threatening cardiorespiratory alterations and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To quantify the junior-to-senior successful transition rate in sprint swimming events in elite European performers. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of publicly available competition data collected between 2004 and 2019. METHODS: The yearly performance of 6631 European swimmers (females=41.8\% of the sample) competing in 50 and 100m freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly were included in the analysis. The junior-to-senior transition rate was determined as the number of elite junior athletes who maintained their elite status in adulthood. To investigate how the definition of elite may affect the calculation of the transition rate, we operationally defined elite athletes as those ranked in the all-time top 10, 25, 50, and 100 in their category. We also calculated the correlation between junior and senior performances. RESULTS: The average transition rates ranged, depending on the age of reference, from 10 to 26\% in males and from 23 to 33\% in females. The transition rate for the top 100 junior swimmers was greater than that for the top 10 swimmers. In general, swimmers who swam 50m showed a slightly lower transition rate compared with those that swam 100m. Depending on the age of reference, low-to-moderate correlations were observed between junior and senior peak performances. CONCLUSIONS: Most elite junior athletes did not maintain the elite level in adulthood. Except for athletes in the last year of the junior category (18years for males and 17years for females), junior performances were poorly correlated with senior performances.},

  abstract = {Aging is associated with chronic low-grade increases in circulating levels of inflammatory markers. A wide range of environmental factors, including smoking, infections, and obesity, genetic factors, and the declining function of sex hormones may contribute to systemic low-grade inflammatory activity in older individuals. Age-associated disease may exacerbate this phenomenon. The multifunctional cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 have been associated with morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Evidence supports the direct role of TNF-alpha in the pathogeneses of atherosclerosis, type 2 DM, and AD in older individuals. Age-related increases in systemic levels of TNF-alpha could provide a unifying basis for these disorders. Furthermore, TNF-alpha induces a catabolic state that causes frailty. Circulating levels of IL-6 seem to be a strong risk factor for frailty in the elderly, which could reflect its association with increased production of TNF-alpha. IL-6 also may be a risk factor for thromboembolic complications. In healthy, elderly populations, high circulating levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 predict mortality, independent of comorbidity, indicating that TNF-alpha and IL-6 cause morbidity and mortality. In cohorts of frail, older individuals, TNF-alpha and IL-6 also act as disease markers. Circulating levels of TNF-alpha seem to be the best predictor of mortality in frail, elderly populations with a high mortality rate, whereas IL-6 seems to be the strongest risk marker in healthy, elderly populations. This finding could reflect that in relatively healthy old populations the increase in circulating levels of IL-6 represent a systemic response to local proinflammatory activities; however, when age-related inflammatory diseases progress, levels of TNF-alpha increase in the circulation and become gradually a stronger risk marker than IL-6. In conclusion low-grade elevations in levels of circulating cytokines are strong independent risk factors of morbidity and mortality in the elderly, and lifestyle factors and comorbidities may modulate these levels. Exercise and dietary interventions may be possible strategies to decrease inflammatory activity and improve the health status of the elderly.},

  abstract = {1. This study was performed to test the hypothesis that the exercise-induced increase in circulating cytokine levels is associated with muscle damage. Nine healthy young male subjects performed two high-intensity bicycle exercise trials separated by two weeks. The first trial consisted of 30 min of normal bicycle exercise (concentric exercise), whereas the second consisted of 30 min of braking with reversed revolution (eccentric exercise). The work loads were chosen to give the same increases in heart rate and catecholamine levels in the blood during each trial. 2. Significant increases (P {$<$} 0.05) in plasma concentration of creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were observed only after the eccentric exercise. Furthermore, the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in serum increased significantly after the eccentric exercise and was significantly correlated to CK concentration in the following days, whereas no significant changes were found after the concentric exercise. 3. The total concentration of lymphocytes increased significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) as a result of eccentric compared with concentric exercise. This was mainly due to a significantly more pronounced recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells and CD8 positive cells (CD8+ cells) during the eccentric trial. However, no significant differences between the two types of work were found in regard to the circulating concentration of monocytes. The concentration of neutrophils was only significantly increased 2 h after the concentric exercise. 4. The finding that high-intensity eccentric exercise caused a more pronounced increase in the plasma level of IL-6, compared with concentric exercise, supports the hypothesis that the post-exercise cytokine production is related to skeletal muscle damage. The fact that no differences between eccentric and concentric exercise were found in the recruitment of most blood mononuclear cell subsets to the blood supports the hypothesis that the exercise-induced increase in plasma catecholamines is a major determinant of the mobilization of these cells into the blood. However, as eccentric exercise caused a more pronounced increase in the concentration of NK cells and CD8+ cells, factors involved in muscle damage may also contribute to the recruitment of these cells.},

  abstract = {It has been recognized for some time that cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are, to a major extent, inflammatory disorders associated with an environment characterized by a sedentary lifestyle together with abundant intakes of calories. Systemic low-level inflammation is suggested to be a cause as well as consequence of pathological processes with local tumor necrosis factor α production as an important biological driver. It is hypothesized that physical inactivity contributes to an enhanced proinflammatory burden independently of obesity, as regular muscle contractions mediate signals with myokines/cytokines as important messengers, which suppress proinflammatory activity at distant sites as well as within skeletal muscle. Muscle-derived interleukin (IL)-6 is considered to possess a central role in anti-inflammatory activities and health beneficial effects in relation to physical exercise. It is discussed how this fits the consistent observation that enhanced plasma levels of IL-6 represent a strong risk marker in chronic disorders associated with systemic low-level inflammation and all-cause mortality. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.},

Tumour necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha) initiates the inflammatory cascade and has been linked to several age-associated disorders. It remains, however, unknown if TNF-alpha is associated with mortality in old populations. The aim of the present study was to investigate if serum levels of TNF-alpha were associated with all-cause mortality independently of interleukin (IL)-6 in a prospective study of 333 relatively healthy 80-year-old people. A Cox regression model was used to explore effects of TNF-alpha and IL-6 on survival in the following 6 years. A total of 133 participants died during this follow-up period. TNF-alpha was associated with mortality in men, but not in women, whereas low-grade elevations in IL-6 were associated strongly with mortality in both sexes. TNF-alpha explained only 7\% of the variability in IL-6 and effects of the two cytokines were independent of each other as well as of other traditional risk factors for death [smoking, blood pressure, physical exercise, total cholesterol, co-morbidity, body mass index (BMI) and intake of anti-inflammatory drugs]. These findings indicate that at least in old populations chronic elevated levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 have different biological functions that trigger age-associated pathology and cause mortality.},

We conducted a systematic review to examine current conceptualisations of resilience across the contexts of work and competitive sports. Utilising a sample of 52 articles comprising both qualitative and quantitative studies, we comprehensively reviewed research on psychological resilience across these two parallel achievement contexts. Results suggested that a state-like conceptualisation of resilience involving processes of adaptation and growth from stressors appears most amenable to advance research going forward. Correspondingly, there was comprehensive evidence that fluctuations in specific psychological resources may influence resilience capacities to deal with stress. Thus, there may be reciprocal relationships between resilience and a number of psychological resources buffering a broad spectrum of events varying from minor short-term, to moderate, to long-term adversities. Going forward, there is a need for more longitudinal studies to examine the dynamics of state-like conceptualisations of resilience and further examine such reciprocal relationships with various psychological resources.

Very recently, using a controlled in vitro 3D cell model to mimic the bone microenvironment aboard the International Space Station, it has been shown that Irisin treatment in microgravity prevents the down-regulation of the transcription factors Atf4, Runx2 and Osterix, as well as Collagen I and Osteoprotegerin proteins, crucial for osteoblast differentiation in physiologic conditions. Irisin action has also been investigated in human subjects, in which it correlates with bone health status, supporting its physiological importance also in human bone, both in healthy subjects and in patients suffering from diseases related to bone metabolism, such as hyperparathyroidism and type 1 diabetes. Low levels of circulating Irisin have been found in post-menopausal women affected by hyperparathyroidism. Furthermore, Irisin is positively correlated with bone strength in athletes and bone mineral density in football players. Moreover, in healthy children, Irisin is positively associated with bone mineral status and in children with type 1 diabetes, Irisin is positively correlated with improved glycemic control and skeletal health. In this review, we will focus on recent findings about Irisin action on microgravity induced bone loss and on osteocyte activity and survival through its αV/β5 integrin receptor. © 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Summary Wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is nowadays the most widely used index of heat stress, yet many users appear to be unaware of its history and its limitations. History of WBGT: WBGT was invented and first used during the 1950s as one element in a successful campaign to control serious outbreaks of heat illness in training camps of the United States Army and Marine Corps. Control measures based on air temperature and humidity, and applied to all trainees alike, had proved effective but had entailed excessive compliance costs in the form of lost training time. New control measures introduced in 1956 further reduced heat illness and also lost fewer training hours. Crucial innovations were (1) replacing the temperature and humidity measurements with WBGT, which additionally responds to sun and wind, (2) using epidemiologic analyses of casualty records to identify hazardous levels of WBGT and vulnerable trainees, and (3) protecting the most vulnerable trainees by suspending drill at lower levels of WBGT, and by improving their heat tolerance in special conditioning platoons. This campaign has considerable relevance to the prevention of heat illness in sport. Limitations of WBGT: WBGT's most serious limitation is that environments at a given level of the index are more stressful when the evaporation of sweat is restricted (by high humidity or low air movement) than when evaporation is free. As with all indices that integrate elements of the thermal environment, interpretation of the observed levels of WBGT requires careful evaluation of people's activity, clothing, and many other factors, all of which can introduce large errors into any predictions of adverse effects. Moreover, the accuracy of WBGT is being eroded by measurement errors associated with the omission of the globe temperature, with non-standard instrumentation, and with unsatisfactory calibration procedures. Because of the above limitations WBGT can provide only a general guide to the likelihood of adverse effects of heat. A much clearer assessment can be obtained by measuring the individual elements of the thermal environment, and using those measurements to estimate the requirement for evaporative cooling, the likelihood of achieving it, and more accurate and comprehensive indices of heat stress.},

  abstract = {Low-grade inflammation is emerging as a common feature of contemporary metabolic, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. Both physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity are associated with persistent systemic low-grade inflammation. Thus, the behavioral, biological, and physiological changes that cause a predisposition to obesity and other co-morbidities could have epigenetic underpinnings in addition to various evolutionary scenarios. A key assumption involves the potential for a mismatch between the human genome molded over generations, and the issue of adapting to the modern high calorie diet and common built environments promoting inactivity. This biological mismatch appears to have dire health consequences. Therefore, the goal of this article is to provide a brief overview on the importance of inflammation as part of human survival and how physical activity (PA) and physical inactivity are critical regulators of systemic inflammation. The review will highlight anti-inflammatory effects of PA and exercise training from a metabolic and systemic signaling perspective, which includes skeletal muscle to utilization of fatty acids, TLR4 signaling, and myokine/adipokine effects. The available evidence suggests that PA, regular exercise, and weight loss offer both protection against and treatment for a wide variety of chronic diseases associated with low-grade inflammation through an improved inflammatory profile. © 2020 The Authors},

  abstract = {Regular exercise is associated with pronounced health benefits. The molecular processes involved in physiological adaptations to exercise are best understood in skeletal muscle. Enhanced mitochondrial functions in muscle are central to exercise-induced adaptations. However, regular exercise also benefits the brain and is a major protective factor against neurodegenerative diseases, such as the most common age-related form of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, or the most common neurodegenerative motor disorder, Parkinson’s disease. While there is evidence that exercise induces signalling from skeletal muscle to the brain, the mechanistic understanding of the crosstalk along the muscle–brain axis is incompletely understood. Mitochondria in both organs, however, seem to be central players. Here, we provide an overview on the central role of mitochondria in exercise-induced communication routes from muscle to the brain. These routes include circulating factors, such as myokines, the release of which often depends on mitochondria, and possibly direct mitochondrial transfer. On this basis, we examine the reported effects of different modes of exercise on mitochondrial features and highlight their expected benefits with regard to neurodegeneration prevention or mitigation. In addition, knowledge gaps in our current understanding related to the muscle–brain axis in neurodegenerative diseases are outlined. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Irisin, a novel myokine produced in response to physical activity, promotes white-to-brown fat transdifferentiation. The name irisin referred to the ancient Greek goddess Iris, the messenger who delivered (bad) news from the gods. In mice, it has been demonstrated that irisin plays a key role in metabolic regulation, energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis. New findings from various studies carried out in both animals and humans suggest that irisin might also have other favorable effects, such as increasing bone cortical mass, preventing hepatic lipid accumulation, and improving cognitive functions, thus mediating many exercise-induced health benefits. However, data on the role and function of irisin in humans have prompted controversy, due mostly to the only recent confirmation of the presence of irisin in humans. Another strong limitation to the understanding of irisin mechanisms of action is the lack of knowledge about its receptor, which until now remains unidentified in humans and in animals.

The knowledge of the discrete mechanisms allowing the acclimatization both at genetic level or through the cell mediators production in addition to the macroscopic responses of the cardio-circulatory and ventilatory systems to a hypoxic environment has been progressively developed since the last century; moreover granting a safer stay in hypoxic conditions not only for the residents but also for the different cathegories of workers, sportsmen and tourists has been considered a worthy aim of the medical activity. The effects of hypoxia were simulated in laboratory by means of an induced low pressure environment (normobaric hypoxia) or tested on the subjects at different levels of altitude (hypobaric hypoxia). Far from describing all the physiological and pathological responses of the organism, in this review, the authors expose the state of the art in the knowledge of the responsiveness of the pulmonary circle to the acute or chronic hypoxic condition, its possible progression to the pulmonary arterial hypertension, the latter being more appropriately named High-Altitude Pulmonary Hypertension. The currently available therapeutic options in the treatment of High-Altitude Pulmonary Hypertension are also reviewed.},

  abstract = {The masticatory system is a complex and highly organized group of structures, including craniofacial bones (maxillae and mandible), muscles, teeth, joints, and neurovascular elements. While the musculoskeletal structures of the head and neck are known to have a different embryonic origin, morphology, biomechanical demands, and biochemical characteristics than the trunk and limbs, their particular molecular basis and cell biology have been much less explored. In the last decade, the concept of muscle-bone crosstalk has emerged, comprising both the loads generated during muscle contraction and a biochemical component through soluble molecules. Bone cells embedded in the mineralized tissue respond to the biomechanical input by releasing molecular factors that impact the homeostasis of the attaching skeletal muscle. In the same way, muscle-derived factors act as soluble signals that modulate the remodeling process of the underlying bones. This concept of muscle-bone crosstalk at a molecular level is particularly interesting in the mandible, due to its tight anatomical relationship with one of the biggest and strongest masticatory muscles, the masseter. However, despite the close physical and physiological interaction of both tissues for proper functioning, this topic has been poorly addressed. Here we present one of the most detailed reviews of the literature to date regarding the biomechanical and biochemical interaction between muscles and bones of the masticatory system, both during development and in physiological or pathological remodeling processes. Evidence related to how masticatory function shapes the craniofacial bones is discussed, and a proposal presented that the masticatory muscles and craniofacial bones serve as secretory tissues. We furthermore discuss our current findings of myokines-release from masseter muscle in physiological conditions, during functional adaptation or pathology, and their putative role as bone-modulators in the craniofacial system. Finally, we address the physiological implications of the crosstalk between muscles and bones in the masticatory system, analyzing pathologies or clinical procedures in which the alteration of one of them affects the homeostasis of the other. Unveiling the mechanisms of muscle-bone crosstalk in the masticatory system opens broad possibilities for understanding and treating temporomandibular disorders, which severely impair the quality of life, with a high cost for diagnosis and management. © Copyright © 2021 Buvinic, Balanta-Melo, Kupczik, Vásquez, Beato and Toro-Ibacache.},

  abstract = {Exercise is an effective intervention for both the prevention and the treatment of obesity and insulin resistance because skeletal muscle secretes many bioactive proteins that contribute to the beneficial effect of exercise. It has been revealed that irisin plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis and both acute and chronic exercises increase circulating irisin in experimental animal models and in humans. Although previous studies have reported that the irisin-related signaling mechanism may play a beneficial role in the treatment of metabolic diseases including obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus, studies on whether irisin plays a key role in vascular function and vascular complications are still insufficient. Therefore, the current review aims to summarize the accumulating evidence showing the potential role of irisin, especially in vascular reactivity and vascular abnormalities such as atherosclerosis. © 2020 by the authors.

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas were measured with computed tomography (CT). Fat mass (FM) was measured with dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship of waist circumference (WC) and BMI to VAT, SAT, and FM within sex-by-race groups. General linear models were used to compare relationships between WC or BMI, and adiposity across sex and race, within age groups (18-39 and 40-64 years). The sample included 1,667 adults (men: 489 white; 120 AA; women: 666 white, 392 AA). WC and BMI correlations were highest for FM and SAT compared to VAT. Women had higher FM levels than men regardless of WC, but the sex difference in FM was attenuated in younger AA adults with a high BMI. For a given level of WC or BMI, women had higher levels of SAT than men; however, significant interactions indicated that the relationship was not consistent across all levels of BMI and WC. Sex and race differences in VAT varied significantly with WC and BMI. In general, white adults had higher levels of VAT than AA adults at higher levels of BMI and WC. Sex differences, and in some instances race differences, in the relationships between anthropometry and fat-specific depots demonstrate that these characteristics need to be considered when predicting adiposity from WC or BMI.},

  abstract = {Half a decade ago, transmembrane protein fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) was found to be cleaved as a novel myokine irisin, which burst into prominence for browning of white adipose tissue during exercise. However, FNDC5, the precursor of irisin, has been paid relatively little attention compared with irisin despite evidence that FNDC5 is associated with the metabolic syndrome, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's adult population and contributes to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Besides N-terminal and C-terminal sequences, the FNDC5 protein contains an irisin domain and a short transmembrane region. FNDC5 has shown to be widely distribute in different tissues and is highly expressed in heart, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. Clinical studies have demonstrated that FNDC5 is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and dysregulation of FNDC5 will lead to systemic metabolism imbalance and the onset of metabolic disorders. Growing evidence has suggested that FNDC5 gene polymorphisms are related to health and disease in different human populations. Additionally, FNDC5 has been found relevant to the regulation of metabolism and metabolic syndrome through diverse upstream and downstream signaling pathways in experimental studies. The present review summarizes the characteristics, clinical significance, and molecular mechanisms of FNDC5 in metabolic syndrome and proposes a novel concept that FNDC5 is activated by forming a putative ligand-receptor complex. Knowledge about the role of FNDC5 may be translated into drug development and clinical applications for the treatment of metabolic disorders. © 2019 The Authors},

Results: Potential pathophysiological pathways hypothesized to explain the benefits of PA in terms of prostate carcinogenesis include circulating levels of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, sex hormones, and myokines. Clinically, emerging evidences support the hypothesis that PA is associated with decreased PCa risk, improved PCa-related survival, improved functional outcomes, and reduced ADT-related adverse events. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract = {Although interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been associated with insulin resistance, little is known regarding the effects of IL-6 on insulin sensitivity in humans in vivo. Here, we show that IL-6 infusion increases glucose disposal without affecting the complete suppression of endogenous glucose production during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in healthy humans. Because skeletal muscle accounts for most of the insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in vivo, we examined the mechanism(s) by which IL-6 may affect muscle metabolism using L6 myotubes. IL-6 treatment increased fatty acid oxidation, basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, IL-6 rapidly and markedly increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). To determine whether the activation of AMPK mediated cellular metabolic events, we conducted experiments using L6 myotubes infected with dominant-negative AMPK α-subunit. The effects described above were abrogated in AMPK dominant-negative–infected cells. Our results demonstrate that acute IL-6 treatment enhances insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in humans in vivo, while the effects of IL-6 on glucose and fatty acid metabolism in vitro appear to be mediated by AMPK.}

They are also known to secrete osteokines, myokines, and cytokines into the circulation, influencing the biological and pathological activities in local and distant organs and cells. In this regard, even osteoporosis and sarcopenia, which were initially thought to be two independent diseases, have recently been defined under the term “osteosarcopenia”, to indicate a synergistic condition of low bone mass with muscle atrophy and hypofunction. Undoubtedly, osteosarcopenia is a major public health concern, being associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The best current defence against osteosarcopenia is prevention based on a healthy lifestyle and regular exercise. The most appropriate type, intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise to positively influence osteosarcopenia are not yet known. However, combined programmes of progressive resistance exercises, weight-bearing impact exercises, and challenging balance/mobility activities currently appear to be the most effective in optimising musculoskeletal health and function. Based on this evidence, the aim of our review was to summarize the current knowledge about the role of exercise in bone–muscle crosstalk, highlighting how it may represent an effective alternative strategy to prevent and/or counteract the onset of osteosarcopenia. © 2021 by the authors.

Adipocytes orchestrate their adaptation and expansion to provide storage to excess nutrients, the quick mobilisation of fuel to supply peripheral functional demands, insulation, and, in their thermogenic form, heat generation to maintain core body temperature. Thermogenic adipocytes could be targets for anti-obesity and anti-diabetic therapeutic approaches aiming to restore adipose tissue functionality and increase energy dissipation. However, for thermogenic adipose tissue to become therapeutically relevant, a better understanding of its development and origins, its progenitors and their characteristics and the composition of its niche, is essential. Also crucial is the identification of stimuli and molecules promoting its specific differentiation and activation. Here we highlight the structural/cellular differences between human and rodent brown adipose tissue and discuss how obesity and metabolic complication affects brown and beige cells as well as how they could be targeted to improve their activation and improve global metabolic homeostasis. Finally, we describe the limitations of current research models and the advantages of new emerging approaches. © 2018},

  abstract = {The anaerobic lactate threshold (LTan) is used to prescribe training intensity and measure endurance capacity. The LTan identifies a critical point where small increases in workload result in large increases in blood lactate concentration. LTan is usually predicted through visual inspection of a blood lactate (bLa) vs workload plot. Numerous other methods for predicting LTan exist, and the literature lacks a consensus regarding validity of prediction methods. The purpose of this study was to assess the agreement among visual inspection (VI), maximum distance (Dmax) and modified maximum distance (Dmod) from the lactate curve, Baldari \& Guidetti (BG), Dickhuth \& Heck (DH) and Keul (K) methods for predicting the LTan. Blood lactate data was gathered from 8 male elite cross country skiers across two treadmill running incremental exercise tests. The above methods were used to predict LTan. Bland-Altman limits of agreement and Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient analyses were used to compare methods. Agreement was defined as 95\% limits of agreement falling within a maximum allowed difference of ± 0.5 mM bLa between methods. No agreement was found among any of the prediction methods. Mean LTan calculated with the Dmax method was significantly different (p {$<$} 0.05) from mean LTan calculated using each other method. We conclude that the six methods for predicting LTan used in this study are not in agreement and should not be considered equivalent for exercise testing purposes. Future studies should compare agreement between LTan methods and the maximal lactate steady state to determine the most valid LTan prediction method. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

J Strength Cond Res 26(9): 2447–2452, 2012—The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of 3 different stretching methods combined with a warm-up protocol on vertical jump performance. Sixteen young tennis players (14.5 ± 2.8 years; 175 ± 5.6 cm; 64.0 ± 11.1 kg) were randomly assigned to 4 different experimental conditions on 4 successive days. Each session consisted of a general and specific warm-up, with 5 minutes of running followed by 10 jumps, accompanied by one of the subsequent conditions: (a) Control Condition (CC)—5 minutes of passive rest; (b) Passive Stretching Condition (PSC)—5 minutes of passive static stretching; (c) Active Stretching Condition (ASC)—5 minutes of active static stretching; and (d) Dynamic Stretching Condition (DC)—5 minutes of dynamic stretching. After each intervention, the subjects performed 3 squat jumps (SJs) and 3 countermovement jumps (CMJs), which were measured electronically. For the SJ, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance (CC × PSC × ASC × DC) revealed significant decreases for ASC (28.7 ± 4.7 cm; p = 0.01) and PSC (28.7 ± 4.3 cm; p = 0.02) conditions when compared with CC (29.9 ± 5.0 cm). For CMJs, there were no significant decreases (p {$>$} 0.05) when all stretching conditions were compared with the CC. Significant increases in SJ performance were observed when comparing the DC (29.6 ± 4.9 cm; p = 0.02) with PSC (28.7 ± 4.3 cm). Significant increases in CMJ performance were observed when comparing the conditions ASC (34.0 ± 6.0 cm; p = 0.04) and DC (33.7 ± 5.5 cm; p = 0.03) with PSC (32.6 ± 5.5 cm). A dynamic stretching intervention appears to be more suitable for use as part of a warm-up in young athletes.},

Difference between Optojump and Myotest systems was significant (−0.036 ± 0.021 seconds; 95\% CI −0.041 to −0.032; p {$<$} 0.0001), which results in Myotest mean flight time being approximately 7.2\% longer than the Optojump flight time. The association between Optojump and Myotest was nearly perfect (r = 0.91, 95\% CI 0.86–0.94; p {$<$} 0.0001). This study showed that the Optojump and Myotest systems possess convergent validity and can be successfully used under field conditions to assess VJ while performing a CMJ. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting data obtained from different portable systems for field measurement.},

  abstract = {Regular exercise reduces the risk for numerous chronic diseases. Exercise not only impacts the contracting skeletal muscle but also elicits systemic changes. The exact mechanisms driving the more systemic changes have yet to be resolved, but exercise factors are thought to be an important missing link. Exercise factors are proteins that are released from skeletal muscle into the circulation during exercise. They represent a subclass of myokines, which are classified as proteins secreted from skeletal muscle serving a signaling role. Here, we provide an overview of the current literature on myokines. Many studies have focused on the identification of new myokines using a variety of approaches. These studies have generated an extensive list of myokines, but so far, the functional relevance of many of these novel myokines remains unclear. Few of these myokines represent putative exercise factors. Currently, IL-6, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, angiopoietin-like 4, chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 have the highest potential to serve as exercise factors because for all these factors, there is clear evidence that plasma levels increase during exercise. In our view, the future focus should be on characterizing the functional role of myokines in the acute and chronic response to exercise and explore their potential as a target for metabolic diseases.

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Primary: To examine the relationship between relative timing of puberty with bone mineral density (BMD) in a group of adolescent girls; Secondary: To determine if family history of breast cancer was associated with bone mineral density. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal study of girls recruited between 6 and 7~years of age seen every 6~months for 5~years, and subsequently seen annually. BMD of the lumbar spine was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at mean age of 12.5~years; age- and race-specific Z-scores (BMDz) were calculated. Age of pubertal onset was determined by the first occurrence of breast stage 2, and participants were categorized into race-specific early, on-time and late puberty onset groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BMDz by timing of pubertal onset, and by family history of breast cancer. RESULTS: DXA scans were performed on 227 study participants, and a second scan was performed on 114 participants 2~years later. Age of onset of puberty was inversely correlated with BMDz, r~=~-0.31 (P~{$<~$}.0001). There was no association between BMDz and family history of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier timing of puberty was associated with higher BMD. The high shared variance of BMD and timing of pubertal onset implies an underlying biologic basis.},

Some of the mechanisms by which exercise provides these effects are the promotion of an anti-inflammatory state, reinforcement of the neuromuscular function, and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Recently, it has been proposed that physical exercise is able to modify gut microbiota, and thus this could be another factor by which exercise promotes well-being, since gut microbiota appears to be closely related to health and disease.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), known also as myositis, represent challenging group of heterogeneous muscle disorders characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness and evidence of muscle inflammation. The purpose of this review is to provide important updates on cytokines and inflammatory mediators related to myositis. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past 5 years, multiple studies brought a fresh insight into the pathogenesis of myositis by introducing new factors or further characterizing the role of the well established mediators in myositis. Among the mediators reviewed in this article, special attention was paid to interferons, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, interleukin-18 and the IL23/Th17 axis. Some of the recent work has also focused on the nontraditional cytokines, such as adipokines, myokines, S100 proteins, High Mobility Group Box 1 or B-cell activating factor and on several anti-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, microRNAs and their potential to reflect the disease activity or to regulate the inflammatory processes in myositis have recently been subject of intensive investigation. Some of the above-mentioned mediators have been proposed as promising clinical biomarkers or therapeutic targets for myositis. SUMMARY: Several recent studies contributed to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of myositis and highlighted the clinical significance of certain inflammatory mediators. Application of these new findings may help to develop innovative approaches for patients' phenotyping, disease activity monitoring and potentially novel therapies.}

  abstract = {A healthy lifestyle is critical to maintaining safety and preventing rheumatic disease before reaching old age. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune and systemic illness involving joint changes, including inflammation, joint pain, tiredness, elevated risk of developing coronary and heart disease, and rapid loss of muscle mass. The role of exercise in improving the inflammatory pattern has tended to focus on the latest research. However, some physical activities represent a non-pharmacological treatment strategy due to their many benefits, such as improved muscle mass, strength, and efficiency, especially in patients with RA. During exercise, skeletal muscle releases myokines, triggering a direct anti-inflammatory effect with each activity or enhancing comorbidity. The level of inflammatory biomarkers, such as tumour necrosis factor, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6, is significantly lower for athletes and patients with RA who exercise regularly. However, understanding the precise roles of some environmental and genetic factors can help to prevent rheumatic disorders. This review highlights the influence of exercise and training on the inflammatory module in patients with rheumatic disease. More detailed data is needed to clarify the benefits of exercise in the context of RA and inflammation. © Copyright Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2022.},

  abstract = {Obesity and intermittent hypoxia (IH) occurring during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are two independent risk factors for impaired ventricular function; cardiac dysfunction is exacerbated when the two factors co-occur. Regular exercise provides beneficial effects to attenuate cardiac fibrosis by reducing body fat percentage and preventing adipokine dysregulation. However, the mechanisms by which myokines, muscle-derived factors released during exercise, play a role in the prevention of IH-induced cardiac dysfunction, are still unclear. This study investigates the effects of myokines on ventricular dysfunction. The important role that myokines play in cardiac function in patients with OSA is discussed in the literature review. The conclusion of this study is that in obese individuals, excess adipose tissues trigger the dysregulation of adipokines. This dysregulation leads to myocardial inflammation, resulting in left ventricular dysfunction. Physical activity induces an increase in energy expenditure and triggers the release of myokines into the circulation by skeletal muscles, accelerating lipid metabolism, and improving the altered secretion profiles of adipokines. This process helps to alleviate myocardial inflammation and prevents the impairment of ventricular function. The paper suggests that future studies can investigate the effects of myokines on lipid metabolism, including how to reduce fat deposition and alleviate inflammation efficiently. In effect, muscle-derived cytokines (myokines) can be considered as anti-inflammatory mediators. This similarity provides support for advocating that regular exercise provides cardioprotective effects against cardiac function impairment in obese patients with OSA. © 2021, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency \& Critical Care Medicine.},

Within the near-infrared spectrum, light can penetrate biological tissues and be absorbed by chromophores, such as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. What makes fNIRS more advantageous is its portability and potential for long-term monitoring. This paper reviews the basic mechanisms of fNIRS and its current clinical applications, the limitations toward more widespread clinical usage of fNIRS, and current efforts to improve the temporal and spatial resolution of fNIRS toward robust clinical usage within subjects. Oligochannel fNIRS is adequate for estimating global cerebral function and it has become an important tool in the critical care setting for evaluating cerebral oxygenation and autoregulation in patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury. When it comes to a more sophisticated utilization, spatial and temporal resolution becomes critical. Multichannel NIRS has improved the spatial resolution of fNIRS for brain mapping in certain task modalities, such as language mapping. However, averaging and group analysis are currently required, limiting its clinical use for monitoring and real-time event detection in individual subjects. Advances in signal processing have moved fNIRS toward individual clinical use for detecting certain types of seizures, assessing autonomic function and cortical spreading depression. However, its lack of accuracy and precision has been the major obstacle toward more sophisticated clinical use of fNIRS. The use of high-density whole head optode arrays, precise sensor locations relative to the head, anatomical co-registration, short-distance channels, and multi-dimensional signal processing can be combined to improve the sensitivity of fNIRS and increase its use as a wide-spread clinical tool for the robust assessment of brain function.},

  abstract = {A novel integrated physiological model of the interactions between the cardiovascular and respiratory systems has been in development for the past few years. The model has hundreds of parameters and variables representing the physical and physiological properties of the human cardiopulmonary system. It can simulate many dynamic states and scenarios. The description of the model and the results in normal resting conditions were presented in a companion paper (Albanese A, Cheng L, Ursino M, Chbat NW. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 310: 2016; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00230.2014), where model predictions were compared against average population data from literature. However, it is also essential to test the model in abnormal or pathological conditions to prove its consistency. Hence, in this paper, we concentrate on testing the cardiopulmonary model under hypercapnic and hypoxic conditions, by comparing model's outputs to population-averaged cardiorespiratory data reported in the literature. The utility of this comprehensive model is demonstrated by testing the internal consistency of the simulated responses of a significant number of cardiovascular variables (heart rate, arterial pressure, and cardiac output) and respiratory variables (tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, alveolar O 2 and CO 2 partial pressures) over a wide range of perturbations and conditions; namely, hypercapnia at 3–7\% CO 2 levels and hypoxia at 7–9\% O 2 levels with controlled CO 2 (isocapnic hypoxia) and without controlled CO 2 (hypocapnic hypoxia). Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze the role of the main cardiorespiratory control mechanisms triggered by hypercapnia and hypoxia.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a 91 kDa transcription factor, regulates lipid metabolism and long-chain fatty acid oxidation by upregulating the expression of several genes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation pathway. In addition, PGC-1α regulates the expression of mitochondrial genes to control mitochondria DNA replication and cellular oxidative metabolism. Recently, new insights showed that several myokines such as irisin and myostatin are epigenetically regulated by PGC-1α in skeletal muscles, thereby modulating systemic energy balance, with marked expansion of mitochondrial volume density and oxidative capacity in healthy or diseased myocardia. In addition, in our studies evaluating whether PGC-1α overexpression in epicardial adipose tissue can act as a paracrine organ to improve or repair cardiac function, we found that overexpression of hepatic PGC-1α increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation and decreased triacylglycerol storage and secretion in vivo and in vitro. In this review, we discuss recent studies showing that PGC-1α may regulate mitochondrial fusion–fission homeostasis and affect the renal function in acute or chronic kidney injury. Furthermore, PGC-1α is an emerging protein with a biphasic role in cancer, acting both as a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter and thus representing a new and unresolved topic for cancer biology studies. In summary, this review paper demonstrates that PGC-1α plays a central role in coordinating the gene expression of key components of mitochondrial biogenesis and as a critical metabolic regulator in many vital organs, including white and brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and kidney. © 2018 by the authors.

Myokines as mediators provide the conceptual basis for a whole new paradigm useful for understanding how skeletal muscle communicates with other organs. In this review, we summarize and discuss classes of myokines and their physiological functions in mediating the regulatory roles of skeletal muscle on other organs and the regulation of the whole-body energy metabolism. We review the mechanisms involved in the interaction between skeletal muscle and nonmuscle organs through myokines. Moreover, we clarify the connection between exercise, myokines and disease development, which may contribute to the understanding of a potential mechanism by which physical inactivity affects the process of metabolic diseases via myokines. Based on the current findings, myokines are important factors that mediate the effect of skeletal muscle on other organ functions and whole-body metabolism. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

  abstract = {Given the numerous health benefits of exercise, understanding how exercise capacity is regulated is a question of paramount importance. Circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels surge during exercise and IL-6 favors exercise capacity. However, neither the cellular origin of circulating IL-6 during exercise nor the means by which this cytokine enhances exercise capacity has been formally established yet. Here we show through genetic means that the majority of circulating IL-6 detectable during exercise originates from muscle and that to increase exercise capacity, IL-6 must signal in osteoblasts to favor osteoclast differentiation and the release of bioactive osteocalcin in the general circulation. This explains why mice lacking the IL-6 receptor only in osteoblasts exhibit a deficit in exercise capacity of similar severity to the one seen in mice lacking muscle-derived IL-6 (mIL-6), and why this deficit is correctable by osteocalcin but not by IL-6. Furthermore, in agreement with the notion that IL-6 acts through osteocalcin, we demonstrate that mIL-6 promotes nutrient uptake and catabolism into myofibers during exercise in an osteocalcin-dependent manner. Finally, we show that the crosstalk between osteocalcin and IL-6 is conserved between rodents and humans. This study provides evidence that a muscle-bone-muscle endocrine axis is necessary to increase muscle function during exercise in rodents and humans.},

  abstract = {The health benefits of exercise are well-recognized and are observed across multiple organ systems. These beneficial effects enhance overall resilience, healthspan and longevity. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects of exercise, however, remain poorly understood. Since the discovery in 2000 that muscle contraction releases IL-6, the number of exercise-associated signalling molecules that have been identified has multiplied. Exerkines are defined as signalling moieties released in response to acute and/or chronic exercise, which exert their effects through endocrine, paracrine and/or autocrine pathways. A multitude of organs, cells and tissues release these factors, including skeletal muscle (myokines), the heart (cardiokines), liver (hepatokines), white adipose tissue (adipokines), brown adipose tissue (baptokines) and neurons (neurokines). Exerkines have potential roles in improving cardiovascular, metabolic, immune and neurological health. As such, exerkines have potential for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, and possibly in the facilitation of healthy ageing. This Review summarizes the importance and current state of exerkine research, prevailing challenges and future directions. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The current review shows evidence for the role of adipokines in breast cancer (BC) pathogenesis summarizing the mechanisms underlying the association between adipokines and breast malignancy. Special emphasis is given also on intriguing insights into the relationship between obesity and BC as well as on the role of novel adipokines in BC development. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence has underscored the role of the triad of obesity, insulin resistance, and adipokines in postmenopausal BC. Adipokines exert independent and joint effects on activation of major intracellular signal networks implicated in BC cell proliferation, growth, survival, invasion, and metastasis, particularly in the context of obesity, considered a systemic endocrine dysfunction characterized by chronic inflammation. To date, more than 10 adipokines have been linked to BC, and this catalog is continuously increasing. The majority of circulating adipokines, such as leptin, resistin, visfatin, apelin, lipocalin 2, osteopontin, and oncostatin M, is elevated in BC, while some adipokines such as adiponectin and irisin (adipo-myokine) are generally decreased in BC and considered protective against breast carcinogenesis. Further evidence from basic and translational research is necessary to delineate the ontological role of adipokines and their interplay in BC pathogenesis. More large-scale clinical and longitudinal studies are awaited to assess their clinical utility in BC prognosis and follow-up. Finally, novel more effective and safer adipokine-centered therapeutic strategies could pave the way for targeted oncotherapy.},

  abstract = {The benefits of exercise to human health have long been recognised. However, only in the past decade have researchers started to discover the molecular benefits that exercise confers, especially to the central nervous system (CNS). These discoveries include the magnitude of molecular messages that are communicated from skeletal muscle to the CNS. Despite these advances in understanding, very limited studies have been conducted to decipher the molecular benefits of exercise in retinal health and disease. Here, we review the latest work on the effects of exercise on the retina and discuss its effects on the wider CNS, with a focus on demonstrating the potential applicability and comparative molecular mechanisms that may be occurring in the retina. This review covers the key molecular pathways where exercise exerts its effects: oxidative stress and mitochondrial health; inflammation; protein aggregation; neuronal health; and tissue crosstalk via extracellular vesicles. Further research on the benefits of exercise to the retina and its molecular messages within extracellular vesicles is highly topical in this field. © 2021 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists},

  abstract = {Obesity induces an imbalance in the expression and secretion of several cytokines, which contributes to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. On the contrary, skeletal muscle is known to have a role in reversing the detrimental impact of obesity. It has been established that adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ that secretes proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Similarly, skeletal muscle produces secretory molecules, called myokines, from contracting muscle fibers. Myokines were recently recognized as beneficial modulators of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, adipokines and myokines play a crucial role in the communication between adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and other organs. It could be beneficial to find novel adipokines and myokines, and to explore their signaling pathways to identify targets for the treatment and prevention of cardiometabolic disorders. In this review, we summarize recent studies on cross-talk between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In particular, we concentrate on the major action mechanisms of adipokines and myokines, such as adiponectin, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein, C1q/TNF-related proteins, interleukin- 6, irisin, and fibroblast growth factor 21. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract = {Muscle and bone are anatomically and functionally closely connected. The traditional concept that skeletal muscles serve to load bone and transform skeletal segments into a system of levers has been further refined into the mechanostat theory, according to which striated muscle is essential for bone development and maintenance, modelling and remodelling. Besides biomechanical function, skeletal muscle and bone are endocrine organs able to secrete factors capable of modulating biological function within their microenvironment, in nearby tissues or in distant organs. The endocrine properties of muscle and bone may serve to sense and transduce biomechanical signals such as loading, unloading or exercise, or systemic hormonal stimuli into biochemical signals. Nonetheless, given the close anatomical relationship between skeletal muscle and bone, paracrine interactions particularly at the periosteal interface can be hypothesized. These mechanisms can assume particular importance during bone and muscle healing after musculoskeletal injury. Basic studies in vitro and in rodents have helped to dissect the multiple influences of skeletal muscle on bone and/or expression of inside-organ metabolism and have served to explain clinical observations linking muscle-to-bone quality. Recent evidences pinpoint that also bone tissue is able to modulate directly or indirectly skeletal muscle metabolism, thus empowering the crosstalk hypothesis to be further tested in humans in vivo. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Recent Findings: Recent research provides new understanding of the effects of age and systemic factors on the response of bone to loading, of relevance to attempts to provide load therapy for bone in SCI. The rapidly growing dataset describing the biochemical crosstalk between bone and muscle, and the cell and molecular biology of myokines signalling to bone and osteokines regulating muscle metabolism and mass, is reviewed. The ways in which this crosstalk may be altered in SCI is summarised.

Given the relevance of this condition in both clinics and research, biomarkers of frailty have been actively sought after. Although several candidate biomarkers of frailty have been identified, none of them has yet been incorporated in the assessment or monitoring of the condition. Over the last years, increasing research interest has been focused on myokines, a set of cytokines, small proteins and proteoglycan peptides that are synthetized, expressed and released by skeletal myocytes in response to muscular contractions. Myokines may act in autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine manner and regulate several processes associated with physical frailty, including muscle wasting, dynapenia, and slowness.

  abstract = {Inflammatory markers are increased systematically and locally (e.g., skeletal muscle) in stroke patients. Besides being associated with cardiovascular risk factors, proinflammatory cytokines seem to play a key role in muscle atrophy by regulating the pathways involved in this condition. As such, they may cause severe decrease in muscle strength and power, as well as impairment in cardiorespiratory fitness. On the other hand, physical exercise (PE) has been widely suggested as a powerful tool for treating stroke patients, since PE is able to regenerate, even if partially, physical and cognitive functions. However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of physical exercise in poststroke patients remain poorly understood. Thus, in this study we analyze the candidate mechanisms associated with muscle atrophy in stroke patients, as well as the modulatory effect of inflammation in this condition. Later, we suggest the two strongest anti-inflammatory candidate mechanisms, myokines and the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which may be activated by physical exercise and may contribute to a decrease in proinflammatory markers of poststroke patients. © 2016 Hélio José Coelho Junior et al.},

Further studies highlighted the autocrine effect of Irisin on skeletal muscle, and research performed in humans has definitively established that Irisin is a circulating hormone-like myokine, increased by physical activity.

  abstract = {Irisin is a hormone-like myokine produced in abundance by skeletal muscle in response to exercise, both in mice and humans. Once released into the circulation, irisin acts on white adipocytes to induce the browning response and subsequently activates nonshivering thermogenesis. We have examined the premise that irisin produced during exercise may subserve further functions in the musculoskeletal system. We review evidence for its possible skeletal effects, including the central role that irisin plays in the control of bone mass, with positive effects on cortical mineral density and geometry in mice. We also review the autocrine effects of irisin in skeletal muscle, in which it upregulates the expression of its precursor (FNDC5). Since loss of bone and muscle mass occurs with aging, immobility, and several metabolic diseases, future studies exploring the efficacy of irisin in restoring bone and reversing muscle wasting could be important to establishing irisin as a molecule that combines beneficial effects for treating osteoporosis and muscular atrophy. If the results from mice were confirmed in human studies, an irisin-based therapy could be developed for physically disabled or bedridden patients. © 2017 New York Academy of Sciences.},

  abstract = {Irisin is a myokine secreted by the skeletal muscle during physical activity both in mice and humans. Its first identified role was to activate the browning response in white adipocytes, subsequently triggering non-shivering thermogenesis; therefore, Irisin has raised great expectations as a potential target in the treatment of obesity. In 2015, we demonstrated that Irisin plays a central role in the control of bone mass, driving positive effects on cortical mineral density and bone mechanical properties. This effect on the bone was triggered using an Irisin dosage 70 times lower than the one needed to induce the browning response, suggesting that the skeleton is the primary target organ of this myokine. Moreover, our studies also highlighted the autocrine effect of Irisin on the skeletal muscle, overall suggesting that Irisin plays a fundamental role in the physiology of the musculoskeletal system. More recently, we demonstrated the efficacy of Irisin in preventing and restoring bone and muscle losses in a mouse model affected by disuse-induced osteoporosis and muscular atrophy. Hopefully, if future investigations will be confirmed in humans, it may lead to develop an Irisin-based therapy for physically disable or bedridden patients and it might also represent a countermeasure for astronauts subjected to microgravity. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {The concomitant occurrence of osteoporosis and sarcopenia is very common during the process of aging and pathological conditions characterized by the disuse of the musculoskeletal system. However, to date there are no evidence about the mechanism responsible for the coupling of these two process. During the last decade, studies on the interactions between muscle and bone have made remarkable steps forward, establishing that skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ producing and releasing myokines acting in a paracrine or endocrine fashion. Among these, the newly identified myokine Irisin, produced by skeletal muscle after physical exercise, plays a key role in the bone-muscle functional unit, with a major impact on the skeleton by increasing cortical bone mineral density, modifying its geometry and improving bone strength. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies reported an autocrine effect of Irisin on skeletal muscle and highlighted the autocrine myogenic potential of this myokine. This review summarizes new insights on the topic of Irisin action on bone and skeletal muscle, which support the hypothesis that Irisin may represent a novel molecular entity with exercise-mimetic properties. Hopefully future research may expand the knowledge of its ability to improve bone integrity and muscle activity and could pave the way for the use of Irisin as a new therapy for the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, particularly useful for those patients that are not capable of performing physical activity, such as the elderly or bedridden patients. © 2016, Pacini Editore S.p.A.

Recent Findings: The concomitant onset of osteoporosis and sarcopenia is currently one of the main threats that can increase the risk of falling fractures during aging, generating high health care costs due to hospitalization for bone fracture surgery. With the growing emergence of developing innovative therapies to treat these two age-related conditions that often have common onset, a broader understanding of molecular messengers regulating the communication between muscle and bone tissue became imperative. Summary: Recently it has been highlighted that two muscle-derived signals, such as the myokines Irisin and L-BAIBA, positively affect bone tissue. In parallel, there are signals derived from bone that affect either positively the skeletal muscle, such as osteocalcin, or negatively, such as RANKL. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During hypoxia an operators cognitive performance may decline. This decline is linked to altered brain metabolism, resulting in decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Ketone bodies are an alternative substrate to glucose for brain metabolic requirements; previous studies have shown that the presence of elevated ketone bodies in the blood maintains brain ATP levels and reduces cerebral glycolysis during hypoxia. Thus, ketones may be a strategy to mitigate cognitive decline in hypoxia. Ketone ester (KE) consumption allows rapid elevation of blood ketone levels; therefore, we investigated the effects of consuming a KE drink on cognitive performance during hypoxia. Here, we report results of a pilot study. METHODS: There were 11 subjects who completed a cognitive performance test battery under conditions of normoxia and hypoxia following consumption of a KE drink and a placebo control drink. RESULTS: Significant hypoxia effects (O₂ saturation minimum was found to range between 63 and 88 in subjects) were found for blink duration (Ph2 0.665) and blink rate (Ph2 0.626), indicating that the hypoxia condition was associated with longer blink durations and lower blink rates. Significant hypoxia effects were likewise observed for a code substitution task (Ph2 0.487), indicating that performance on the task was significantly disrupted by the hypoxia stressor. KE consumption had a significant effect on blink duration (Ph2 0.270) and the code substitution task (Ph2 0.309). DISCUSSION: These finding suggest that some effects of acute hypoxia can be mitigated by nutritional ketosis. Coleman K, Phillips J, Sciarini M, Stubbs B, Jackson O, Kernagis D.

Currently, little data exists regarding the physical demands of professional rugby league, with evidence being solely represented through sub-elite10 and junior players.18 This knowledge however, is fundamental when designing strength and conditioning programmes and specific to this article, fitness testing batteries. Therefore, the purpose of this article is two fold. Firstly, to conduct a needs analysis of rugby league and thus identify the fundamental fitness parameters. Then secondly, compare and contrast tests deemed suitable to assess these and from which a testing battery will be advised. The fitness testing battery will also be considered based on the practical experience gained from working with professional rugby league teams. This is an important step in bridging the gap between the theory and application of sport science, whereby the constraints of the work place can also be commented on.},

Epigeal changes that accelerate the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators in response to nutritional factors and life style are not fully known. Numerous proinflammatory transcription pathways have been described where nuclear factor kappa B plays a critical role in stimulating proinflammatory gene promoter region interdependent with epigenetic machinery. Of the many cytokines, adipokines, myokines involved in the evolution of NAFLD from simple steatosis to NASH and cirrhosis, the most important is the balance between proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL 6 on one hand and adiponectin on the other hand, these factors being produced by Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells and inflammatory hepatocytes. Starting from the classical "two hit" theory of the pathogenesis of NAFLD, recent studies have revealed the important role of free cholesterol, diacylglycerols and ceramides in the induction of insulin resistance by stimulating sterol-element-binding protein 1c and thus stimulating de novo lipogenesis. The important roles of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress endoplasmic reticulum, inflammasomes, hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis have also been highlighted. © Copyright 2015 Celsius Publishing House.},

  abstract = {Much hypoxia research has been carried out at high altitude in a hypobaric hypoxia (HH) environment. Many research teams seek to replicate high-altitude conditions at lower altitudes in either hypobaric hypoxic conditions or normobaric hypoxic (NH) laboratories. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that the only relevant condition that differs between these settings is the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), which is commonly presumed to be the principal physiological stimulus to adaptation at high altitude. This systematic review is the first to present an overview of the current available literature regarding crossover studies relating to the different effects of HH and NH on human physiology. After applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Several studies reported a number of variables (e.g. minute ventilation and NO levels) that were different between the two conditions, lending support to the notion that true physiological difference is indeed present. However, the presence of confounding factors such as time spent in hypoxia, temperature, and humidity, and the limited statistical power due to small sample sizes, limit the conclusions that can be drawn from these findings. Standardisation of the study methods and reporting may aid interpretation of future studies and thereby improve the quality of data in this area. This is important to improve the quality of data that is used for improving the understanding of hypoxia tolerance, both at altitude and in the clinical setting.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Resistance exercise induces muscle growth and is an important treatment for age-related losses in muscle mass and strength. Myokines are hypothesized as a signal conveying physiological information to skeletal muscle, possibly to “fine-tune” other regulatory pathways. While myokines are released from skeletal muscle following contraction, their role in increasing muscle mass and strength in response to resistance exercise or training is not established. Recent research identified both local and systemic release of myokines after an acute bout of resistance exercise. However, it is not known whether myokines with putative anabolic function are mechanistically involved in producing muscle hypertrophy after resistance exercise. Further, nitric oxide (NO), an important mediator of muscle stem cell activation, upregulates the expression of certain myokine genes in skeletal muscle. Method: In the systemic context of complex hypertrophic signaling, this review: (1) summarizes literature on several well-recognized, representative myokines with anabolic potential; (2) explores the potential mechanistic role of myokines in skeletal muscle hypertrophy; and (3) identifies future research required to advance our understanding of myokine anabolism specifically in skeletal muscle. Result: This review establishes a link between myokines and NO production, and emphasizes the importance of considering systemic release of potential anabolic myokines during resistance exercise as complementary to other signals that promote hypertrophy. Conclusion: Investigating adaptations to resistance exercise in aging opens a novel avenue of interdisciplinary research into myokines and NO metabolites during resistance exercise, with the longer-term goal to improve muscle health in daily living, aging, and rehabilitation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review: The age-related loss of skeletal muscle and bone tissue decreases functionality and increases the risk for falls and injuries. One contributing factor of muscle and bone loss over time is chronic low-grade inflammation. Exercise training is an effective countermeasure for decreasing the loss of muscle and bone tissue, possibly by enhancing immune system response. Herein, we discuss key interactions between the immune system, muscle, and bone in relation to exercise perturbations, and we identify that there is substantial “cross-talk” between muscle and bone and the immune system in response to exercise. Recent Findings: Recent advances in our understanding of the “cross-talk” between muscle and bone and the immune system indicate that exercise is likely to mediate many of the beneficial effects on muscle and bone via their interactions with the immune system. Summary: The age-related loss of muscle and bone tissue may be partially explained by an impaired immune system via chronic low-grade inflammation. Exercise training has a beneficial effect on immune system function and aging muscle and bone. Theoretically, the “cross-talk” between the immune system, muscle, and bone in response to exercise enhances aging musculoskeletal health. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Sudden cardiac arrest is most often the first clinical manifestation of an underlying cardiovascular disease and usually occurs in previously asymptomatic athletes. The risk benefit ratio of physical exercise differs between young competitive athletes and middle-age/senior individuals engaged in leisure-time sports activity. Competitive sports are associated with an increase in the risk of sudden cardiovascular death (SCD) in susceptible adolescents and young adults with underlying cardiovascular disorders. In middle-age/older individuals, physical activity can be regarded as a ‘two-edged sword': vigorous exertion increases the incidence of acute coronary events in those who did not exercise regularly, whereas habitual physical activity reduces the overall risk of myocardial infarction and SCD. Although cardiovascular pre-participation evaluation offers the potential to identify athletes with life-threatening cardiovascular abnormalities before onset of symptoms and may reduce their risk of SCD, there is a significant debate among cardiologists about efficacy, impact of false-positive results and cost-effectiveness of routine screening. This review presents an appraisal of the available data and criticisms concerning screening programmes aimed to prevent SCD of either young competitive athletes or older individuals engaged in leisure-time sports activity},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: When an athlete is injured, the primary focus of the sports medicine team is to treat the physical effects of the injury. However, many injured athletes experience negative psychological responses, including anxiety, regarding their injury. OBJECTIVE: To compare the anxiety and social support of athletes with concussions and a matched group of athletes with orthopaedic injuries. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Athletic training room. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 525 injuries among athletes from 2 Big Ten universities were observed. Of these, 63 concussion injuries were matched with 63 orthopaedic injuries for the athlete's sex, sport, and time loss due to injury. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical measures included the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (which measures both state and trait anxiety) and the modified 6-item Social Support Questionnaire. RESULTS: The group with concussions relied on their family for social support 89\% of the time, followed by friends (78\%), teammates (65\%), athletic trainers (48\%), coaches (47\%), and physicians (35\%). The group with orthopaedic injuries relied on their family for social support 87\% of the time, followed by friends (84\%), teammates (65\%), athletic trainers (57\%), coaches (51\%), and physicians (36\%). We found no differences for the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (t = -1.38, P = .193) between the concussed and orthopaedic-injury groups. Social Support Questionnaire scores were significant predictors for postinjury state anxiety. Specifically, increased scores were associated with decreased postinjury state anxiety (beta = -4.21, P = .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Both the concussed athletes and those with orthopaedic injuries experienced similar state and trait anxiety and relied on similar sources of social support postinjury. However, athletes with orthopaedic injuries reported greater satisfaction with support from all sources compared with concussed athletes. In contrast, concussed athletes showed more significant predictor models of social support on state anxiety at return to play.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION:               Exposure to high ambient altitudes above 10,000\,ft (3048\,m) over sea level during aviation can present the risk of hypobaric hypoxia. Hypoxia can impair sensory and cognitive functions, degrading performance and leading to mishaps. Military aircrew  undergo regular hypoxia familiarization training to recognize their symptoms and understand the consequences of hypoxia. However, over the years, aviators have come to believe that individuals have a “personal hypoxia signature.” The idea is that intraindividual variability in  symptom experience during repeated exposure is low. In other words, individuals will experience the same symptoms during hypoxia from day to day, year to year.               METHODS:               We critically reviewed the existing literature on this hypothesis. Most studies that claim to support the notion  of a signature only examine group-level data, which do not inform individual-level consistency. Other studies use inappropriate statistical methods, while still others do not control for accuracy of recall over the period of years. To combat these shortcomings, we present a dataset of 91 individuals  who completed nearly identical mask-off, normobaric hypoxia exposures days apart.               RESULTS:               We found that for every symptom on the Hypoxia Symptom Questionnaire, at least half of the subjects reported the symptom inconsistently across repeated exposure. This means that, at best, 50\%  of subjects did not report the same symptom across exposures.               DISCUSSION:               These data provide compelling evidence against the existence of hypoxia signatures. We urge that hypoxia familiarization training incorporate these findings and encourage individuals to expect a wide range  of hypoxia symptoms upon repeated exposure.

  abstract = {In the elderly, whole-body health largely relies on healthy skeletal muscle, which controls body stability, locomotion, and metabolic homeostasis. Age-related skeletal muscle structural/functional deterioration is associated with a higher risk of severe comorbid conditions and poorer outcomes, demanding major socioeconomic costs. Thus, the need for efficient so-called geroprotective strategies to improve resilience and ensure a good quality of life in older subjects is urgent. Skeletal muscle senescence and metabolic dysregulation share common cellular/intracellular mechanisms, potentially representing targets for intervention to preserve muscle integrity. Many factors converge in aging, and multifaceted approaches have been proposed as interventions, although they have often been inconclusive. Physical exercise can counteract aging and metabolic deficits, not only in maintaining tissue mass, but also by preserving tissue secretory function. Indeed, skeletal muscle is currently considered a proper secretory organ controlling distant organ functions through immunoactive regulatory small peptides called myokines. This review provides a current perspective on the main biomolecular mechanisms underlying age-dependent and metabolic deterioration of skeletal muscle, herein discussed as a secretory organ, the functional integrity of which largely depends on exercise and myokine release. In particular, muscle-derived interleukin (IL)-6 is discussed as a nutrient-level biosensor. Overall, exercise and vitamin D are addressed as optimal geroprotective strategies in view of their multi-target effects. © 2020 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {The concept that extra-skeletal functions of vitamin D impact on human health have taken place since quite ago. Among all, the beneficial effects of vitamin D on immune regulation, skeletal muscle function, and metabolism are undeniable. Adequate vitamin D levels maintain the immune system and skeletal muscle metabolism integrity, promoting whole-body homeostasis; hypovitaminosis D associates with the important decline of both tissues and promotes chronic inflammation, which is recognized to underlie several disease developments. Growing evidence shows that the immune system and skeletal muscle reciprocally dialogue, modulating each other's function. Within this crosstalk, vitamin D seems able to integrate and converge some biomolecular signaling towards anti-inflammatory protective effects. Thus, vitamin D regulation appears even more critical at the immune system-muscle signaling intersection, rather than at the single tissue level, opening to wider/newer opportunities in clinical applications to improve health. This paper aims to focus on the immune system-skeletal muscle interplay as a multifaceted target for vitamin D in health and disease after recalling the main regulatory functions of vitamin D on those systems, separately. Some myokines, particularly relevant within the immune system/skeletal muscle/vitamin D networking, are discussed. Since vitamin D supplementation potentially offers the opportunity to maintain health, comments on this issue, still under debate, are included. © 2020 by the authors.},

Twelve female collegiate volleyball players (mean ± SD; age 19.5 ± 1.1 yr; height 1.71 ± 0.06 m; mass 71.3 ± 8.54 kg) volunteered for this study. Data collection lasted a total of 3 weeks, and each subject performed all 3 stretching protocols, 1 session per week, with 1 week between sessions. The order of the stretching protocols was randomized for each subject. During each testing session, all subjects performed a 5-minute light jog as a warm-up, followed by 8 minutes of 1 of the stretching protocols. One minute after the completion of each protocol, 5 maximal CMJ were performed on a force platform, with each jump separated by 1 minute of passive recovery. Jump heights were calculated by integrating the vertical force trace. There were no significant differences between the SS, DS, and NS conditions for any of the jumps (p {$>$} 0.05). Despite the lack of significant effects for the group, there were notable individual responses to each of the warm-up conditions. Practitioners should be aware of the individual responses of their athletes to different types of warm-up protocols before athletic performance and the possible impact of prescribing or eliminating certain exercises.},

Sarcopenia is a condition which is defined by the gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and function with age. In research and clinical practice, sarcopenia is recognized as a component of geriatric disease and is a current target for drug development. In this review we define this condition and provide an overview of current therapeutic approaches. We further highlight recent findings that describe key pathophysiological phenotypes of this condition, including alterations in muscle fiber types, mitochondrial function, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism, myokines, and gut microbiota, in aged muscle compared to young muscle or healthy aged muscle. The last part of this review examines new therapeutic avenues for promising treatment targets. There is still no accepted therapy for sarcopenia in humans.

  abstract = {Cancer cachexia is a complicated disorder of extreme, progressive skeletal muscle wasting. It is directed by metabolic alterations and systemic inflammation dysregulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that increased systemic inflammation promotes this type of cachexia and have suggested that cytokines are implicated in the skeletal muscle loss. Exercise is firmly established as an anti-inflammatory therapy that can attenuate or even reverse the process of muscle wasting in cancer cachexia. The interleukin IL-6 is generally considered to be a key player in the development of the microenvironment of malignancy; it promotes tumor growth and metastasis by acting as a bridge between chronic inflammation and cancerous tissue and it also induces skeletal muscle atrophy and protein breakdown. Paradoxically, a beneficial role for IL-6 has also been identified recently, and that is its status as a “founding member” of the myokine class of proteins. Skeletal muscle is an important source of circulating IL-6 in people who participate in exercise training. IL-6 acts as an anti-inflammatory myokine by inhibiting TNFα and improving glucose uptake through the stimulation of AMPK signaling. This review discusses the action of IL-6 in skeletal muscle tissue dysfunction and the role of IL-6 as an “exercise factor” that modulates the immune system. This review also sheds light on the main considerations related to the treatment of muscle wasting in cancer cachexia. Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society}

  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key players of intercellular communication and mediate crosstalk between tissues. Metastatic tumors release tumorigenic EVs, capable of pre-conditioning distal sites for organotropic metastasis. Growing evidence identifies muscle cell-derived EVs and myokines as potent mediators of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism. Muscle-derived EVs cargo myokines and other biological modulators like microRNAs, cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins hence, are likely to modulate the remodeling of niches in vital sites, such as liver and adipose tissues. Despite the scarcity of evidence to support a direct relationship between muscle-EVs and cancer metastasis, their indirect attribution to the regulation of niche remodeling and the establishment of pre-metastatic homing niches can be put forward. This hypothesis is supported by the role of muscle-derived EVs in findings gathered from other pathologies like inflammation and metabolic disorders. In this review, we present and discuss studies that evidently support the potential roles of muscle-derived EVs in the events of niche pre-conditioning and remodeling of metastatic tumor microenvironment. We highlight the potential contributions of the integrin-mediated interactions with an emerging myokine, irisin, to the regulation of EV-driven microenvironment remodeling in tumor metastasis. Further research into muscle-derived EVs and myokines in cancer progression is imperative and may hold promising contributions to advance our knowledge in the pathophysiology, progression and therapeutic management of metastatic cancers. © Copyright © 2021 Darkwah, Park, Myint, Ito, Appiah, Obeng, Kawamoto and Shimaoka.},

Collectively termed “exercise factors,” these molecules represent a topical area of research given their speculated contribution to both acute exercise metabolism and adaptation to exercise training. In addition to acute changes induced by exercise, the resting profile of circulating exercise factors may be altered by exercise training. Many exercise factors are speculated to be transported in circulation as the cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and in particular, a sub-category termed “small EVs.” This review describes an overview of exercise factors, small EVs and the effects of exercise, but is specifically focused on a critical appraisal of methodological approaches and current knowledge in the context of changes in the resting profile small EVs induced by exercise training, and the potential bioactivities of preparations of these “exercise-trained” small EVs. Research to date can only be considered preliminary, with interpretation of many studies hindered by limited evidence for the rigorous identification of small EVs, and the conflation of acute and chronic responses to exercise due to sample timing in proximity to exercise. Further research that places a greater emphasis on the rigorous identification of small EVs, and interrogation of potential bioactivity is required to establish more detailed descriptions of the response of small EVs to exercise training, and consequent effects on exercise adaptation. © Copyright © 2021 Darragh, O’Driscoll and Egan.},

  abstract = {Metabolic bone disease occurs when there is a net loss in bone density. Osteoporosis, the most common metabolic bone disease, is a devastating problem and an increasingly major public health issue. A substantial body of evidence in the elderly population indicates that a relationship exists between the components of body weight and various measures of bone/mass, density, and function. Both muscle and fat contribute to the body’s total weight and the intimate associations of muscle, fat, and bone are known. But the close functional interactions between muscle and bone or fat and bone are largely unidentified and have drawn much attention in recent years. Each of these tissues not only responds to afferent signals from traditional hormone systems and the central nervous systems but also secretes factors with important endocrine functions. Studies suggest that during growth, development, and aging, the relationship of muscle and fat with the skeleton possibly governs bone homeostasis and turnover. A better understanding of the endocrine function and the cellular and molecular mechanisms and pathways linking muscle or adipose tissues with bone anabolism and catabolism is a new avenue for novel pathways for anabolic drug discovery. These in turn will likely lead to more rational therapy toward increasingly prevalent disorders like osteoporosis. In this review, some of the recent works on the interaction of bone with muscle and fat are highlighted, and in so doing the role of parathyroid hormone (PTH), and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) is surveyed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Dietary stress such as obesity and short-term changes in energy balance can disrupt ovarian function leading to infertility. Adipose tissue secretes hormones (adipokines), such as leptin and adiponectin, that are known to alter ovarian function. Muscles can also secrete endocrine factors, and one such family of myokines, the eleven Fibronectin type III domain-containing (FNDC) proteins, is emerging as important for energy sensing and homeostasis. In this review, we summarize the known roles the FNDC proteins play in energy homeostasis and explore potential impacts on fertility in females. The most well-known member, FNDC5, is the precursor of the 'exercise hormone', irisin, secreted by both muscle and adipose tissue. The receptors for irisin are integrins, and it has recently been shown to alter steroidogenesis in ovarian granulosa cells although the effects appear to be species or context specific, and irisin may improve uterine and placental function in women and rodent models. Another member, FNDC4, is also cleaved to release a bioactive protein that modulates insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues and whose receptor, ADGRF5, is expressed in the ovary. As obese women and farm animals in negative energy balance (NEB) both have altered insulin sensitivity, secreted FNDC4 may impact ovarian function. We propose a model in which NEB or dietary imbalance alters plasma irisin and secreted FNDC4 concentrations, which then act on the ovary through their cognate receptors to reduce granulosa cell proliferation and follicle health. Research into these molecules will increase our understanding of energy sensing and fertility and may lead to new approaches to alleviate post-partum infertility. In Brief: Hormones secreted by muscle cells (myokines) are involved in the adaptive response to nutritional and metabolic changes. In this review, we discuss how one family of myokines may alter fertility in response to sudden changes in energy balance.},

Generally, in both the male and female groups, younger recruits tended to perform better than the older recruits with results between the “under 20” and the 20–24-year-old-age groups performing significantly better than the 35–39-year-old-age group in both sexes, and the 25–29-year-old-age group performing significantly better than the 35–39-year-old-age group in female officers. The data provided in this study provides a profile for performance of male and female recruits of various ages on the PCT in preparation for entry, or re-entry following injury, into the NZ Police. However, given that the PCT is considered a measure of occupational task performance, consideration should be given to the use of sex and age neutral requirements as the occupational tasks performed by police officers exhibit the same traits regardless of sex or age. Older trainees may therefore need conditioning to improve PCT times and subsequently occupational performance.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {This article outlines a Darwinian approach to sports that takes into account its profoundly cultural character and thereby overcomes the traditional nature-culture dichotomies in the sociology of sport. We argue that there are good reasons to view sports as culturally evolved signaling systems that serve a function similar to (biological) courtship rituals in other animals. Our approach combines the insights of evolutionary psychology, which states that biological adaptations determine the boundaries for the types of sport that are possible, and pure cultural theories, which describe the mechanism of cultural evolution without referring to sport’s biological bases. Several biological and cultural factors may moderate the direct effect that signaling value has on a sport’s viability or popularity. Social learning underlies many aspects of the cultural control of sports, and sports have evolved new cultural functions more-or-less unrelated to mate choice as cultural evolution itself became important in humans.},

  abstract = {The proportion of elderly populations is rapidly booming, and human lifespan has considerably increased in the past century because of scientific and medical advances. However, the winds of change brought by the 21st century made sedentarism one of the factors that renders the brain vulnerable to age-related chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conversely, physical exercise has been shown to stimulate molecular mechanisms beneficial to cognition. Here, we review evidence showing the positive effects of physical exercise in the brain. We further discuss recent evidence that irisin, a myokine stimulated by physical exercise derived from fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) transmembrane protein, has neuroprotective actions in the brain. Lastly, we highlight the importance of the crosstalk between the periphery and the brain in cognition and the therapeutic potential of FNDC5/irisin in AD.

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle is an essential regulator of energy homeostasis and a potent coordinator of exercise-induced adaptations in other organs including the liver, fat or the brain. Skeletal muscle-initiated crosstalk with other tissues is accomplished though the secretion of myokines, protein hormones which can exert autocrine, paracrine and long-distance endocrine effects. In addition, the enhanced release or uptake of metabolites from and into contracting muscle cells, respectively, likewise can act as a powerful mediator of tissue interactions, in particular in regard to the central nervous system. The present review will discuss the current stage of knowledge regarding how exercise and the muscle secretome improve a broad range of brain functions related to vascularization, neuroplasticity, memory, sleep and mood. Even though the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the communication between muscle and brain is still poorly understood, physical activity represents one of the most effective strategies to reduce the prevalence and incidence of depression, cognitive, metabolic or degenerative neuronal disorders, and thus warrants further study. © 2018 Delezie and Handschin.},

  abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods are slowly creeping into all fields of science and are becoming ever more popular in applied research. Although it is very attractive to use Bayesian statistics, our personal experience has led us to believe that naively applying Bayesian methods can be dangerous for at least 3 main reasons: the potential influence of priors, misinterpretation of Bayesian features and results, and improper reporting of Bayesian results. To deal with these 3 points of potential danger, we have developed a succinct checklist: the WAMBS-checklist (When to worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics). The purpose of the questionnaire is to describe 10 main points that should be thoroughly checked when applying Bayesian analysis. We provide an account of "when to worry" for each of these issues related to: (a) issues to check before estimating the model, (b) issues to check after estimating the model but before interpreting results, (c) understanding the influence of priors, and (d) actions to take after interpreting results. To accompany these key points of concern, we will present diagnostic tools that can be used in conjunction with the development and assessment of a Bayesian model. We also include examples of how to interpret results when "problems" in estimation arise, as well as syntax and instructions for implementation. Our aim is to stress the importance of openness and transparency of all aspects of Bayesian estimation, and it is our hope that the WAMBS questionnaire can aid in this process.

Hypoglycemia [1.3 +/- 0.2 mumol/ml, (+/-SE); n = 9] did not produce an isoelectric EEG and did not affect base-line CBF or CMRO2. When arterial O2 content was reduced from 17.4 +/- 0.6 to 7.5 +/- 0.5 and 5.1 +/- 0.2 vol\% during hypoglycemia, CBF increased from 25 +/- 3 to 54 +/- 6 and 84 +/- 8 ml.100 g-1.min-1, respectively. This response was not different from that during normoglycemia (3.5 +/- 0.3 mumol/ml; n = 12). During normoglycemia, hypoxia increased CMRglu from 17.0 +/- 1.2 to 32.2 +/- 4.7 and 49.9 +/- 6.6 mumol.100 g-1.min-1, respectively. Hypoglycemia did not affect CMRglu during normoxia, but the hypoxia-induced increase in CMRglu was abolished. CMRO2 during hypoxia was unaffected by hypoglycemia. We conclude that levels of hypoglycemia that do not produce an isoelectric EEG may impair the normal increase in CMRglu during hypoxia but do not alter the global CBF response to hypoxia.},

In skeletal muscle, binding of the insulin to insulin receptor (IR) initiates a signaling cascade that results in the translocation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter protein 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane which leads to facilitated diffusion of glucose into the cell. Understanding the precise signaling events guiding insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is pivotal, because impairment in these signaling events leads to development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

  abstract = {Introduction: The individual glucose threshold (IGT) has been used to estimate the anaerobic threshold with low-cost analyses and shorter times. However, the reliability of the glycemic analysis using a portable pharmacy glucose meter has received little attention. Objective: To identify the IGT using a portable glucose meter and to compare it with the ventilatory threshold (VT). Methods: Fourteen active, healthy men (25.9 ± 3.2 years; \%BF = 17.9 ± 3.7\%) performed an incremental treadmill test. The anaerobic threshold was identified by two different methods: (1) IGT, corresponding to the intensity of the lowest glucose value during the test; and (2) VT, corresponding to the break in linearity of the ventilation curve and an increase in the respiratory oxygen equivalent, without an equivalent increase in carbon dioxide. Results: There were significant differences between VT (9.9 ± 1.2 km/h) and IGT (9.5 ± 1/1 km/h), corresponding to 75.4 ± 9.2 and 72.5 ± 10.4\%VO2max, respectively. The methods presented high correlation (r = 0.82, p = 0.002) and the Bland-Altman technique showed agreement between IGT and VT, with a mean difference of 0.5 km/h. Conclusion: It was possible to determine the intensity of IGT by the glycemic response in the incremental test using a portable glucose meter. The IGT underestimated the intensity of VT by approximately 0.5 km/h, but with a high correlation and agreement between them. Level of evidence III, Case-Controle Study. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Introducción: El umbral glucémico individual (UGI) ha sido utilizado para estimar el umbral anaeróbico con bajo costo de los análisis y también en menor tiempo. Sin embargo, se presta poca atención a la confiabilidad de los análisis glucémicos a través del glucómetro portátil de farmacia. Objetivo: Determinar el UGI a través de glucómetro portátil y comparar con el umbral de ventilación (UV). Métodos: Catorce hombres sanos y activos (25,9 ± 3,2 años; \%G = 17,9 ± 3,7\%) realizarán una prueba incremental en cinta. El umbral anaeróbico se determinó mediante dos metodologías: (1) UGI correspondiente a la intensidad del valor glucémico más bajo durante la prueba; (2) UV, correspondiente a la quiebra de la linealidad de la curva de la ventilación y aumento del equivalente respiratorio de oxígeno sin aumento del equivalente de dióxido de carbono. Resultados: Se observaron diferencias significativas entre UV (9,9 ± 1,2 km/h) y UGI (9,5 ± 1,1 km/h), correspondiendo a 75,4 ± 9,2 y 72,5 ± 10,4, \%VO2max, respectivamente. Las dos metodologías presentaron una correlación alta (r = 0,82, p = 0,002) entre sí. La técnica de Bland-Altman evidenció concordancia entre los métodos UGI y UV, con una diferencia media de 0,5 km/h. Conclusión: Fue posible determinar la intensidad del UGI por medio de la respuesta glucémica en prueba incremental con el uso de glucómetro portátil de farmacia. El UGI subestimó en aproximadamente 0,5 km/h la intensidad del UV, sin embargo, con alta correlación y concordancia entre ellos. Nivel de evidencia III, Estudio de caso-control.

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Chronic exposure to a T2DM microenvironment with hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, oxidative stress and increased levels of proinflammatory mediators, has negative consequences to the cardiovascular system and mental health. Therefore, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and mental health issues have been strongly associated with T2DM. Lifestyle modifications, including physical exercise training, are necessary to prevent T2DM development and its associated complications. It is widely known that the regular practice of exercise provides several physiological benefits to subjects with T2DM, such as managing glycemic and blood pressure levels. Different types of exercise, from aerobic to resistance training, are effective to improve mental health and cognitive function in T2DM. Irisin is a myokine produced in response to exercise, which has been pointed as a relevant mechanism of action to explain the benefits of exercise on cardiovascular and mental health in T2DM patients. Here, we review emerging clinical and experimental evidence about exercise-linked irisin consequences to cardiovascular and mental health in T2DM. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Cumulative epidemiological evidence shows that regular exercise lowers the risk of developing breast cancer and decreases the risk of disease recurrence. The causality underlying this relation has not been fully established, and the exercise recommendations for breast cancer patients follow the general physical activity guidelines, prescribing 150~min of exercise per week. Thus, elucidations of the causal mechanisms are important to prescribe and implement the most optimal training regimen in breast cancer prevention and treatment. The prevailing hypothesis on the positive association within exercise oncology has focused on lowering of the basal systemic levels of cancer risk factors with exercise training. However, another rather overlooked systemic exercise response is the marked acute increases in several potential anti-cancer components during each acute exercise bout. Here, we review the evidence of the exercise-mediated changes in systemic components with the ability to influence breast cancer progression. In the first part, we focus on systemic risk factors for breast cancer, i.e., sex hormones, insulin, and inflammatory markers, and their adaptation to long-term training. In the second part, we describe the systemic factors induced acutely during exercise, including catecholamines and myokines. In conclusion, we propose that the transient increases in exercise factors during acute exercise appear to be mediating the positive effect of regular exercise on breast cancer progression. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Physical activity (PA) has been central in the life of our species for most of its history, and thus shaped our physiology during evolution. However, only recently the health consequences of a sedentary lifestyle, and of highly energetic diets, are becoming clear. It has been also acknowledged that lifestyle and diet can induce epigenetic modifications which modify chromatin structure and gene expression, thus causing even heritable metabolic outcomes. Many studies have shown that PA can reverse at least some of the unwanted effects of sedentary lifestyle, and can also contribute in delaying brain aging and degenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer’s Disease, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. Most importantly, PA improves cognitive processes and memory, has analgesic and antidepressant effects, and even induces a sense of wellbeing, giving strength to the ancient principle of “mens sana in corpore sano” (i.e., a sound mind in a sound body). In this review we will discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of PA on brain health, focusing on hormones, neurotrophins, and neurotransmitters, the release of which is modulated by PA, as well as on the intra-and extra-cellular pathways that regulate the expression of some of the genes involved. © 2019 by the authors.

  abstract = {Cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non-specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. In addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. This short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non-structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. Multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. Today, the term "cytokine" encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. As of this writing, 33 cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. There are certainly over 100 separate genes coding for cytokine-like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. Also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. A recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being "autoimmune" or "autoinflammatory" thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Background: The concept of the muscle as a secretory organ, developed during the last decades, partially answers to the issue of how the crosstalk between skeletal muscle and distant tissues happens. The beneficial effects of exercise transcend the simple improved skeletal muscle functionality: systemic responses to exercise have been observed in distal organs like heart, kidney, brain and liver. Increasing data have accumulated regarding the synthesis, the kinetics of release and the biological roles of muscular cytokines, now called myokines. The most recent techniques have meaningfully improved the identification of the muscle cell secretome, but several iss ues regarding the extent of secretion from the muscle as well as the actions of the myokines remain unexplained. Methods: The goal of this review is to provide an update about the secretory properties of skeletal muscle during and after an acute bout of exercise and after exercise training, showing the main experimental evidences, but also speculate about the possible therapeutic use of the physical training-induced circulating factors, especially in some categories of patients in which the baseline conditions are heavily damaged by one or more pathological conditions. Results: studies on myokines are relatively recent, and to date most of the evidence available in humans has focused on the biological role of Il-6 during muscle contraction. Regarding to the myokines more recently identified, for example myostatin, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) or follistatin-like 1 some of these seem to be promising therapeutic agents, but our awareness about their potential benefits towards human health is only at the beginning. Conclusion: for many of the myokines identified to date, the information available is limited and not enough to characterize precise functions and activities carried out by those in man. Several issues need to be addressed by future studies, tailored to ascertain accurately and surely the biological role and the therapeutic potential of some myokines. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract = {Exercise training prevents the onset and the development of many chronic diseases, acting as an effective tool both for primary and for secondary prevention. Various mechanisms that may be the effectors of these beneficial effects have been proposed during the past decades: some of these are well recognized, others less. Muscular myokines, released during and after muscular contraction, have been proposed as key mediators of the systemic effects of the exercise. Nevertheless the availability of an impressive amount of evidence regarding the systemic effects of muscle-derived factors, few studies have examined key issues: (I) if skeletal muscle cells themselves are the main source of cytokine during exercise; (II) if the release of myokines into the systemic circulation reach an adequate concentration to provide significant effects in tissues far from skeletal muscle; (III) what may be the role carried out by muscular cytokine regarding the well-known benefits induced by regular exercise, first of all the anti-inflammatory effect of exercise. Furthermore, a greater part of our knowledge regarding myokines derives from the muscle of healthy subjects. This knowledge may not necessarily be transferred per se to subjects with chronic diseases implicating a direct or indirect muscular dysfunction and/or a chronic state of inflammation with persistent immune-inflammatory activation (and therefore increased circulating levels of some cytokines): cachexia, sarcopenia due to multiple factors, disability caused by neurological damage, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) or coronary artery disease (CAD). A key point of future studies is to ascertain how is modified the muscular release of myokines in different categories of unhealthy subjects, both at baseline and after rehabilitation. The purpose of this review is to discuss the main findings on the role of myokines as putative mediators of the therapeutic benefits obtained through regular exercise in the context of secondary cardiovascular prevention. © Annals of Translational Medicine.},

Visual go/no-go discriminative and simple response tasks were used. Participants included 17 disabled athletes, 9 from open-skill (wheelchair basketball) and eight from closed-skill (swimming) sports, and 18 healthy non-athletes. Reaction times of the disabled athletes were slower than those of healthy non-athletes on both tasks (7\% and 13\% difference, respectively). Intra-individual variations in reaction times, switch cost, and number of false alarms, were higher in the swimmers, but comparable to healthy non-athletes, in the basketball group. Event-related potentials (ERPs) early components P1, N1, and P2 had longer latencies in the disabled athletes. The late P3 component had longer latency and smaller amplitude in the disabled athletes only in the discriminative response task. The N2 component, which reflected inhibition/execution processing in the discriminative response task, was delayed and reduced in the swimmer group, but was comparable to healthy subjects in the basketball group. Our results show that (1) the ERP components related to perceptual processing, and late components related to executive processing, were impaired in disabled subjects; and (2) open-skill sports such as basketball may partially compensate for executive control impairment by fostering the stability of motor responses and favoring response flexibility.},

The immune system plays a vital role in progression to plaque rupture.

In this review, we discuss how regular exercise can lower systemic inflammation directly via modulation of the immune system or indirectly via altered myokine concentrations and metabolites. We describe the exercise-induced responses of various myokines (such as IL-6, adiponectin, and FGF21), and how cell function in the innate immune system can be modulated via regular exercise, with the aim to modulate plaque formation in atherosclerosis.

Exercise is widely promoted by medical professionals to aid both physical and emotional wellbeing; however, mechanisms through which this is achieved are less well understood. Despite numerous beneficial attributes, certain types of exercise can inflict significant significant physiological stress. Several studies document a key relationship between exercise and immune activation. Activation of the innate immune system occurs in response to exercise and it is proposed this is largely mediated by cytokine signalling. Cytokines are typically classified according to their inflammatory properties and evidence has shown that cytokines expressed in response to exercise are diverse and may act to propagate, modulate or mitigate inflammation in musculoskeletal health. The review summarizes the existing literature on the relationship between exercise and the immune system with emphasis on how exercise-induced cytokine expression modulates inflammation and the immune response. © 2022, The Author(s).},

This study showed that the theoretical validity and reliability of even nonstandardized, highly applied assessment tools can be evaluated. The ProPS was found to have good preliminary levels of divergent validity and immediate utility. The ProPS was also preliminarily found to have acceptable levels of known-group, concurrent, and convergent evidence, as well as test–retest reliability. Athletes in higher resilience and/or lower concentration disruption groups tended to report higher levels of effectiveness in selected psychological strategies. This case study can be useful for sport experts, especially sport psychology practitioners, wishing to use the ProPS to measure athletes' psychological strategies and for those aiming to evaluate their own applied assessment tool.

  abstract = {The Constrained Model of Total Energy Expenditure predicts that increased physical activity may not influence total energy expenditure, but instead, induces compensatory energetic savings in other processes. Much remains unknown, however, about concepts of energy expenditure, constraint and compensation in different populations, and it is unclear whether this model applies to endurance athletes, who expend very large amounts of energy during training and competition. Furthermore, it is well-established that some endurance athletes consciously or unconsciously fail to meet their energy requirements via adequate food intake, thus exacerbating the extent of energetic stress that they experience. Within this review we A) Describe unique characteristics of endurance athletes that render them a useful model to investigate energy constraints and compensations, B) Consider the factors that may combine to constrain activity and total energy expenditure, and C) Describe compensations that occur when activity energy expenditure is high and unmet by adequate energy intake. Our main conclusions are as follows: A) Higher activity levels, as observed in endurance athletes, may indeed increase total energy expenditure, albeit to a lesser degree than may be predicted by an additive model, given that some compensation is likely to occur; B) That while a range of factors may combine to constrain sustained high activity levels, the ability to ingest, digest, absorb and deliver sufficient calories from food to the working muscle is likely the primary determinant in most situations and C) That energetic compensation that occurs in the face of high activity expenditure may be primarily driven by low energy availability i.e., the amount of energy available for all biological processes after the demands of exercise have been met, and not by activity expenditure per se.},

They also modify energy homeostasis, lipid, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism, regulate inflammation and exchange information (crosstalk) between remote organs.

  abstract = {Adipose, skeletal, and hepatic muscle tissues are the main endocrine organs that produce adipokines, myokines, and hepatokines. These biomarkers can be harmful or beneficial to an organism and still perform crosstalk, acting through the endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine pathways. This study aims to review the crosstalk between adipokines, myokines, and hepatokines. Far beyond understanding the actions of each biomarker alone, it is important to underline that these cytokines act together in the body, resulting in a complex network of actions in different tissues, which may have beneficial or non‐beneficial effects on the genesis of various physiological disorders and their respective outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Overweight individuals secrete more proinflammatory adipokines than those of a healthy weight, leading to an impaired immune response and greater susceptibility to inflammatory and infectious diseases. Myostatin is elevated in proinflammatory environments, sharing space with pro‐inflammatory organokines, such as tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α), interleukin‐1 (IL‐1), resistin, and chemerin. Fibroblast growth factor FGF21 acts as a beta‐oxidation regulator and decreases lipogenesis in the liver. The crosstalk mentioned above can interfere with homeostatic disorders and can play a role as a potential therapeutic target that can assist in the methods of diagnosing metabolic syndrome and CVD. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by steatosis, lobular inflammation, and enlargement of the diameter of hepatocytes (ballooning hepatocytes), with or without fibrosis. It affects 20\% of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Due to liver dysfunction and the numerous metabolic changes that commonly accompany the condition (obesity, insulin re-sistance, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome), the secretion of organokines is modified, which may contribute to the pathogenesis or progression of the disease. In this sense, this study aimed to perform a review of the role of organokines in NASH. Thus, by combining descriptors such as NASH, organokines, oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, a search was carried out in the EMBASE, MEDLINE-PubMed, and Cochrane databases of articles published in the last ten years. Insulin resistance, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, fructose, and intestinal microbiota were factors identified as participating in the genesis and progression of NASH. Changes in the pattern of organokines secretion (adipokines, myokines, hepatokines, and osteokines) directly or indirectly contribute to aggravating the condition or compromise homeosta-sis. Thus, further studies involving skeletal muscle, adipose, bone, and liver tissue as endocrine organs are essential to better understand the modulation of organokines involved in the pathogen-esis of NASH to advance in the treatment of this disease. © 2022 by the authors.

We highlight mechanisms that govern normal muscle function that are also key players for VML, including intracellular calcium signaling/homeostasis, mitochondria signaling (calcium, reactiove oxidative species (ROS)/oxidative stress), and angiogenesis. We propose an integration of these processes within the context of emerging biomaterials that provide structural support for muscle regeneration. We posit that new biomarkers (i.e. myokines and lipid signaling mediators) may serve as sentinels of early muscle injury and regeneration. We conclude that as new ideas, approaches, and models come together, new treatments will emerge to allow the full rebuilding of skeletal muscles and functional recovery of skeletal muscles after VML. © 2021},

  abstract = {Exercise during pregnancy is associated with improved health outcomes for both mother and baby, including a reduced risk of future obesity and susceptibility to chronic diseases. Overwhelming evidence demonstrates a protective effect of maternal exercise against fetal birth weight extremes, reducing the rates of both large-and small-for-gestational-age infants. It is speculated that this protective effect is mediated in part through exercise-induced regulation of maternal physiology and placental development and function. However, the specific mechanisms through which maternal exercise regulates these changes remain to be discovered. We hypothesize that myokines, a collection of peptides and cytokines secreted from contracting skeletal muscles during exercise, may be an important missing link in the story. Myokines are known to reduce inflammation, improve metabolism and enhance macronutrient transporter expression and activity in various tissues of nonpregnant individuals. Little research to date has focused on the specific roles of the myokine secretome in the context of pregnancy; however, it is likely that myokines secreted from exercising skeletal muscles may modulate the maternal milieu and directly impact the vital organ of pregnancy—the placenta. In the current review, data in strong support of this potential role of myokines will be presented, suggesting myokine secretion as a key mechanism through which maternal exercise optimizes fetal growth trajectories. It is clear that further research is warranted in this area, as knowledge of the biological roles of myokines in the context of pregnancy would better inform clinical recommendations for exercise during pregnancy and contribute to the development of important therapeutic interventions. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

What is seldom considered when examining the immune response of an aged individual is that the immune system is profoundly influenced by physical activity. Habitual physical activity levels decline with age, with significant consequences for muscle mass and function. Skeletal muscle is a major immune regulatory organ and generates a range of proteins, termed myokines, which have anti-inflammatory and immunoprotective effects. Several studies indicate that maintaining physical activity has immune benefits in older adults, for example, it reduces the systemic inflammation associated with chronic age-related diseases. Here, we discuss how physical activity can prevent or ameliorate age-related multi-morbidity by boosting immune function, and we consider whether physical activity could improve immunotherapy outcomes in age-related conditions such as cancer. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.}

  abstract = {Different aspects of perfectionism have been associated with an array of adaptive and maladaptive cognitive, affective, and behavioural correlates in sport. However, relatively little is known about the links between athletes' perfectionistic tendencies and their state-level thoughts and expectancies (i.e. mindset) in the lead up to competition. The purpose of this study was to explore relationships between perfectionistic strivings, perfectionistic concerns, and the future-oriented thoughts (i.e. worries) and expectancies (i.e. optimism) of athletes as they prepared to compete. A sample of 144 male youth high-performance Canadian football players (M age = 16.41 years, SD = 1.48) completed domain-specific measures of perfectionism, pre-competitive worry, and optimism 24 h prior to the start of an important competition. Canonical correlation (RC) analysis produced two interpretable canonical functions. In the first canonical function, a canonical variate resembling a maladaptive profile of perfectionism (i.e. high strivings combined with high concerns) was positively correlated (RC1 =.66) with a canonical variate consisting of high worry and low optimism. In the second canonical function, a canonical variate resembling an adaptive profile of perfectionism (i.e. high strivings combined with low concerns) was positively correlated (RC2 =.48) with a canonical variate consisting of low worry and high optimism. The results highlight the importance of treating perfectionism as a multidimensional construct and indicate that the pre-competitive mindset of athletes (as reflected by the degree to which athletes worry and feel optimistic) appears to be associated with athletes' perfectionistic orientations in sport.

  abstract = {Here we review available data on nitric oxide (NO)-mediated signaling in skeletal muscle during physical exercise. Nitric oxide modulates skeletal myocyte function, hormone regulation, and local microcirculation. Nitric oxide underlies the therapeutic effects of physical activity whereas the pharmacological modulators of NO-mediated signaling are the promising therapeutic agents in different diseases. Nitric oxide production increases in skeletal muscle in response to physical activity. This molecule can alter energy supply in skeletal muscle through hormonal modulation. Mitochondria in skeletal muscle tissue are highly abundant and play a pivotal role in metabolism. Considering NO a plausible regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis that directly affects cellular respiration, we discuss the mechanisms of NO-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in the skeletal muscle cells. We also review available data on myokines, the molecules that are expressed and released by the muscle fibers and exert autocrine, paracrine and/or endocrine effects. The article suggests the presence of putative interplay between NO-mediated signaling and myokines in skeletal muscle. Data demonstrate an important role of NO in various diseases and suggest that physical training may improve health of patients with diabetes, chronic heart failure, and even degenerative muscle diseases. We conclude that NO-associated signaling represents a promising target for the treatment of various diseases and for the achievement of better athletic performance. © 2015 Dyakova, Kapilevich, Shylko, Popov and Anfinogenova.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle represents the largest organ of the body in non-obese individuals and is now considered to be an active endocrine organ releasing a host of so-called myokines. These myokines are part of a complex network that mediates communication between muscle, the liver, adipose tissue, the brain and other organs. Recent data suggest that myokines regulated by muscle contraction may play a key role in mediating the health-promoting effects of regular physical activity. Although hundreds of myokines have recently been described in proteomic studies, we currently have a rather limited knowledge of the specific role these myokines play in the prevention of insulin resistance, inflammation and associated metabolic dysfunction. Several myokines are known to have both local and endocrine functions, but in many cases the contribution of physical activity to the systemic level of these molecules remains as yet unexplored. Very recently, novel myokines such as irisin, which is thought to induce a white to brown shift in adipocytes, have gained considerable interest as potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarise the most recent findings on the role of myokines in the regulation of substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. We further explore the role of myokines in the regulation of inflammation and provide a critical assessment of irisin and other myokines regarding their potential as therapeutic targets. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In humans, the functional allocation of myokines remains limited and recent findings on fibre type-specific myokine signatures point to an additional level of complexity. Myokines are involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of physical activity and, therefore, critically counteract insulin resistance and the metabolic perturbations of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Results of a study of 51 work teams in a manufacturing company, measuring antecedent, process, and outcome variables, show that team psychological safety is associated with learning behavior, but team efficacy is not, when controlling for team psychological safety. As predicted, learning behavior mediates between team psychological safety and team performance. The results support an integrative perspective in which both team structures, such as context support and team leader coaching, and shared beliefs shape team outcomes.

  abstract = {The quest for a practical index of relative body weight that began shortly after actuaries reported the increased mortality of their overweight policyholders culminated after World War II, when the relationship between weight and cardiovascular disease became the subject of epidemiological studies. It became evident then that the best index was the ratio of the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters, or the Quetelet Index described in 1832. Adolphe Quetelet (1796-1874) was a Belgian mathematician, astronomer and statistician, who developed a passionate interest in probability calculus that he applied to study human physical characteristics and social aptitudes. His pioneering cross-sectional studies of human growth led him to conclude that other than the spurts of growth after birth and during puberty, 'the weight increases as the square of the height', known as the Quetelet Index until it was termed the Body Mass Index in 1972 by Ancel Keys (1904-2004). For his application of comparative statistics to social conditions and moral issues, Quetelet is considered a founder of the social sciences. His principal work, 'A Treatise of Man and the development of his faculties' published in 1835 is considered 'one of the greatest books of the 19th century'. A tireless promoter of statistical data collection based on standard methods and definitions, Quetelet organized in 1853 the first International Statistical Congress, which launched the development of 'a uniform nomenclature of the causes of death applicable to all countries', progenitor of the current International Classification of Diseases.},

Impairment in skeletal muscle and the cardiovascular system, two interrelated systems, results in compromised functional status in aging. Increased oxidative stress and inflammation in older subjects constitute the background for skeletal muscle and cardiovascular system alterations. Aged skeletal muscle mass and strength impairment is related to anabolic resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress and inflammation as well as a reduced antioxidant response and myokine profile. Arterial stiffness and endothelial function stand out as the main cardiovascular alterations related to aging, where increased systemic and vascular oxidative stress and inflammation play a key role. Physical activity and exercise training arise as modifiable determinants of functional outcomes in older persons. Exercise enhances antioxidant response, decreases age-related oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory signals, and promotes the activation of anabolic and mitochondrial biogenesis pathways in skeletal muscle. Additionally, exercise improves endothelial function and arterial stiffness by reducing inflammatory and oxidative damage signaling in vascular tissue together with an increase in antioxidant enzymes and nitric oxide availability, globally promoting functional performance and healthy aging. This review focuses on the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in aged musculoskeletal and vascular systems and how physical activity/exercise influences functional status in the elderly. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review:The recently identified myokine, irisin has raised great expectations as a potential target in the conservative treatment of obesity. This review focuses on studies exploring the effects of irisin in humans. Recent findings: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 α expression in skeletal muscles is induced by exercise followed by expression of the membrane protein fibronectin type III domain containing 5. After cleavage from fibronectin type III domain containing 5, irisin is secreted into blood increasing thermogenesis by browning of subcutaneous white/beige adipose tissue. Although clear-cut data have been reported in rodents, the thermogenic effect of irisin in humans remains controversial. The initially reported exercise-dependent increase of irisin in humans could not be confirmed in most studies. However, a robust finding in human studies is the association of irisin with BMI. Summary: The discovery of irisin provides more insight into exercise-induced browning of adipose tissue, and therefore leads to a better understanding of mechanisms underlying body weight regulation and further down the road possibly may lead to treatment strategies of diseases with greatly altered body weight such as obesity or anorexia nervosa. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

Likewise, contradictory evidence was shown associating irisin plasma levels with cardiovascular and metabolic parameters such as glucose, insulin resistance, and cholesterol and other lipid and fatty acid plasma levels in healthy children, as well as in those with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Gender, puberty, and hormonal differences were also examined. Furthermore, important contradictory findings according to the type and duration of exercise and of dietetic interventions in healthy and unhealthy subjects were demonstrated. In addition, correlations between mother–infant relations and circulating irisin were also identified. This review discusses the potential role of irisin in health and disease in the pediatric population. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle works as a secretory organ with the capacity to produce hundreds of myokines. This finding provides a conceptual basis for understanding how muscles communicate with other organs such as adipose tissue, liver, pancreas, bones, and brain. The myokine IL-6 is released into the blood during exercise and it has been shown that IL-6 has multiple immunologic and metabolic effects. Here, we discuss recent advances regarding the physiology of IL-6. Human studies show that IL-6 infusion delays gastric emptying, reduces postprandial glucose concentrations and reduces insulin secretion, whereas experimental studies suggest a role for IL-6 in appetite regulation. Evidence is also accumulating for a central role of IL-6 in training-induced loss of visceral adipose tissue mass in humans. Moreover, recent experimental studies in mice show that voluntary exercise suppresses tumor growth through epinephrine-dependent and IL-6-dependent mobilization and redistribution of cytotoxic NK cells. It has been known for a while that IL-6 is a pleiotropic molecule; however, recent advances suggest that the physiological roles of IL-6 involve multiple aspects of metabolism as well as a role in tumor defense. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd}

  abstract = {The discovery of irisin as an exercise-regulated myokine inducing browning of WAT has gained interest as a potential new strategy to combat obesity and its associated disorders, such as type 2 diabetes. However, there are inconsistencies regarding the relevance of irisin in humans. The regulation of FNDC5 mRNA expression by exercise and contraction could not be reproduced by a number of human studies using several exercise protocols and in vitro approaches. Furthermore, the nature of FNDC5 fragments and the presence of irisin in humans are questionable and probably contribute to conflicting data obtained with commercially available ELISA kits. Most importantly, the information regarding the concentration of circulating irisin in humans is not clear, as different studies using different kits measure irisin levels in a wide range. Data about the role of irisin in states of human obesity and metabolic diseases are conflicting and, in some cases, changes in irisin levels have been observed; they were only moderate in 10-20\%. Independent of the presence and regulation of FNDC5/irisin in humans, the application of recombinant irisin could still represent a therapeutic strategy to fight obesity. However, the current data obtained from human cell models reveal that FNDC5/irisin has no effect on browning of the major WAT depots in humans and is likely to selectively target a small subpopulation of adipocytes, which are located in classical BAT regions, such as the supraclavicular adipose tissue. Thus, other candidates, such as BMP7 or CNPs, seem to be more prominent candidates as inducers of browning in humans. © 2014 Society for Endocrinology.},

The aim of this study is to investigate acute effects of dynamic and static stretching on horizontal-vertical jump distance of recreational athletes and determine which stretching type should be used in sports requiring high power and anaerobic performance such as jumping by revealing how stretching type affects horizontal-vertical jump performance. 47 males with a mean (±Standard Deviation) age of 20.6 (±1.7) years, a mean height of 178.2 (±5.9) cm, a mean body weight of 72.4 (±9.1) kg, and a mean body mass index of 22.8 (±2.7) kg/m 2 were included in this study. All participants were applied three different programs involving only warm-up (method A), warm-up+ dynamic stretching (method B) and warm-up+ static stretching (method C) after 5 minutes of warm-up run and 2 minutes of active rest. After warm-up and stretching protocols, horizontal and vertical jump tests were performed 3 times and the best values were used for analysis. " The descriptive data analysis method " , " the repeated measures ANOVA test " and " the LSD test " were performed using SPSS 20.0 for data analysis. The results are presented as mean± standard deviation. p{$<$}0.05 was accepted as the statistical significance level. According to the data obtained in the study, different stretching types did not affect horizontal jump distance (p: 0.44, F: 0.82), whereas a statistically significant difference was found in terms of vertical jump distance after static stretching (p: 0.048, F: 2.86). As a result, we can say that both dynamic and static stretching could be safely used before sport activities requiring high power and static stretching leads to positive results on a statistically significant level.},

Although "physical activity" and "physical exercise" are two terms with some differences in meaning, compared to sedentary lifestyle, active people have lower cardiovascular risk and lower inflammatory markers. Activities of skeletal muscle reveal "myokines" which have roles in both the immune system and adipose tissue metabolism. In vitro and ex-vivo studies have shown beneficial effects of exercise on inflammation markers. Meanwhile in clinical studies, some conflicting results suggested that type of activity, exercise duration, body composition, gender, race and age may modulate anti-inflammatory effects of physical exercise. Medical data on patients with inflammatory diseases have shown beneficial effects of exercise on disease activity scores, patient well-being and inflammatory markers. Although the most beneficial type of activity and the most relevant patient group for anti-inflammatory benefits are still not clear, studies in elderly and adult people generally support anti-inflammatory effects of physical activity and moderate exercise could be advised to patients with cardiovascular risk such as patients with metabolic syndrome.

Like other hypothalamic nuclei, the SCN displays an impressive array of distinct cell types characterized by differences in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression. Individual SCN neurons and glia are able to display self-sustained circadian rhythms in cellular function that are regulated at the molecular level by a 24h transcriptional-translational feedback loop. Remarkably, SCN cells are able to harmonize with one another to sustain coherent rhythms at the tissue level. Mechanisms of cellular communication in the SCN network are not completely understood, but recent progress has provided insight into the functional roles of several SCN signaling factors. This review discusses SCN organization, how intercellular communication is critical for maintaining network function, and the signaling mechanisms that play a role in this process. Despite recent progress, our understanding of SCN circuitry and coupling is far from complete. Further work is needed to map SCN circuitry fully and define the signaling mechanisms that allow for collective timekeeping in the SCN network.},

  abstract = {Background: Aging is associated with body composition changes that include a reduction of muscle mass or sarcopenia and an increase in visceral obesity. Thus, aging involves a muscle-fat imbalance with a shift toward more fat and less muscle. Therefore, sarcopenic obesity, defined as a combination of sarcopenia and obesity, is a global health phenomenon due to the increased aging of the population combined with the increased epidemic of obesity. Previous studies have shown inconsistent association between sarcopenic obesity and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Aims: To systematically review the recent literature on the CVD risks associated with sarcopenic obesity and summarizes ways of diagnosis and prevention. Methods: A systematic review of studies that reported the association between sarcopenic obesity and CVD risk in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. Results: Risk factors of sarcopenic obesity included genetic factors, aging, malnutrition, sedentary lifestyle, hormonal deficiencies and other molecular changes. The muscle-fat imbalance with increasing age results in an increase in the pro-inflammatory adipokines secreted by adipocytes and a decline in the anti-inflammatory myokines secreted by myocytes. This imbalance promotes and perpetuates a chronic low-grade inflammatory state that is characteristic of sarcopenic obesity. After application of exclusion criteria, only 12 recent studies were included in this review. The recent studies have shown a consistent association between sarcopenic obesity and cardiovascular disease risk although most of the studies are of cross-sectional design that does not confirm a causal relationship. In addition, most of the population studied were of Asian origin which may limit the generalizability of the results. Non-pharmacological interventions by exercise training and adequate nutrition appear to be useful in maintenance of muscle strength and muscle mass in combination with a reduction of adiposity to promote healthy aging. Conclusions: Sarcopenic obesity appears to increase the risk of CVD in older people; however, future prospective studies of diverse population are still required. Although non-pharmacologic interventions are useful in reducing the risk of sarcopenic obesity, novel specific pharmacologic agents are lacking. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {This review addresses the impact of bariatric surgery on the endocrine aspects of white adipose tissue, muscle and the liver. We describe literature supporting the notion that adipokines, myokines and hepatokines likely act in concert and drive many of the long-term metabolic improvements following surgery. Circulating adiponectin is increased while secretion of pro-inflammatory interleukins (1, 6 and 8) decreases, alongside leptin secretion. The metabolic improvements observed in the muscle might relate to reduction of myokines contributing to insulin resistance (including myostatin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor-21). Subject to exception, hepatokine secretion is generally increased (such as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2, adropin and sex hormone-binding globulin). In conclusion, bariatric surgery restores metabolic functions by enhancing the time-dependent secretion of anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizing and antilipemic factors. Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms by which these factors may trigger the remission of obesity-related comorbidities following bariatric surgery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

  abstract = {Creatine, a very popular supplement among athletic populations, is of growing interest for clinical applications. Since over 90\% of creatine is stored in skeletal muscle, the effect of creatine supplementation on muscle metabolism is a widely studied area. While numerous studies over the past few decades have shown that creatine supplementation has many favorable effects on skeletal muscle physiology and metabolism, including enhancing muscle mass (growth/hypertrophy); the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This report reviews studies addressing the mechanisms of action of creatine supplementation on skeletal muscle growth/hypertrophy. Early research proposed that the osmotic effect of creatine supplementation serves as a cellular stressor (osmosensing) that acts as an anabolic stimulus for protein synthesis signal pathways. Other reports indicated that creatine directly affects muscle protein synthesis via modulations of components in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Creatine may also directly affect the myogenic process (formation of muscle tissue), by altering secretions of myokines, such as myostatin and insulin-like growth factor-1, and expressions of myogenic regulatory factors, resulting in enhanced satellite cells mitotic activities and differentiation into myofiber. Overall, there is still no clear understanding of the mechanisms of action regarding how creatine affects muscle mass/growth, but current evidence suggests it may exert its effects through multiple approaches, with converging impacts on protein synthesis and myogenesis. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract = {During the last nearly 50 years, the blood lactate curve and lactate thresholds (LTs) have become important in the diagnosis of endurance performance. An intense and ongoing debate emerged, which was mainly based on terminology and/or the physiological background of LT concepts. The present review aims at evaluating LTs with regard to their validity in assessing endurance capacity. Additionally, LT concepts shall be integrated within the ‘aerobic-anaerobic transition’ — a framework which has often been used for performance diagnosis and intensity prescriptions in endurance sports.Usually, graded incremental exercise tests, eliciting an exponential rise in blood lactate concentrations (bLa), are used to arrive at lactate curves. A shift of such lactate curves indicates changes in endurance capacity. This very global approach, however, is hindered by several factors that may influence overall lactate levels. In addition, the exclusive use of the entire curve leads to some uncertainty as to the magnitude of endurance gains, which cannot be precisely estimated. This deficiency might be eliminated by the use of LTs.The aerobic-anaerobic transition may serve as a basis for individually assessing endurance performance as well as for prescribing intensities in endurance training. Additionally, several LT approaches may be integrated in this framework. This model consists of two typical breakpoints that are passed during incremental exercise: the intensity at which bLa begin to rise above baseline levels and the highest intensity at which lactate production and elimination are in equilibrium (maximal lactate steady state [MLSS]).Within this review, LTs are considered valid performance indicators when there are strong linear correlations with (simulated) endurance performance. In addition, a close relationship between LT and MLSS indicates validity regarding the prescription of training intensities.A total of 25 different LT concepts were located. All concepts were divided into three categories. Several authors use fixed bLa during incremental exercise to assess endurance performance (category 1). Other LT concepts aim at detecting the first rise in bLa above baseline levels (category 2). The third category consists of threshold concepts that aim at detecting either the MLSS or a rapid/distinct change in the inclination of the blood lactate curve (category 3).Thirty-two studies evaluated the relationship of LTs with performance in (partly simulated) endurance events. The overwhelming majority of those studies reported strong linear correlations, particularly for running events, suggesting a high percentage of common variance between LT and endurance performance. In addition, there is evidence that some LTs can estimate the MLSS. However, from a practical and statistical point of view it would be of interest to know the variability of individual differences between the respective threshold and the MLSS, which is rarely reported.Although there has been frequent and controversial debate on the LT phenomenon during the last three decades, many scientific studies have dealt with LT concepts, their value in assessing endurance performance or in prescribing exercise intensities in endurance training. The presented framework may help to clarify some aspects of the controversy and may give a rationale for performance diagnosis and training prescription in future research as well as in sports practice.}

METHODS:~           We studied the relationship between skin pigment and oximeter accuracy in 36 subjects (19 males, 17 females) of a range of skin tones. Clip-on type sensors and adhesive/disposable finger probes for the Masimo Radical, Nellcor N-595, and Nonin 9700 were studied. Semisupine subjects breathed air-nitrogen-CO2 mixtures via a mouthpiece to rapidly achieve 2- to 3-min stable plateaus of Sao2. Comparisons of Sao2 measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) with Sao2 (by Radiometer OSM-3) were used in a multivariate model to assess the source of errors.           RESULTS:~           The mean bias (Spo2 − Sao2) for the 70\%–80\% saturation range was 2.61\% for the Masimo Radical with clip-on sensor, −1.58\% for the Radical with disposable sensor, 2.59\% for the Nellcor clip, 3.6\% for the Nellcor disposable, −0.60\% for the Nonin clip, and 2.43\% for the Nonin disposable. Dark skin increased bias at low Sao2; greater bias was seen with adhesive/disposable sensors than with the clip-on types. Up to 10\% differences in saturation estimates were found among different instruments in dark-skinned subjects at low Sao2.           CONCLUSIONS:~           Multivariate analysis indicated that Sao2 level, sensor type, skin color, and gender were predictive of errors in Spo2 estimates at low Sao2 levels. The data suggest that clinically important bias should be considered when monitoring patients with saturations below 80\%, especially those with darkly pigmented skin; but further study is needed to confirm these observations in the relevant populations.},

The focus is the so-called metabolic advantage in low-carbohydrate diets – greater weight loss compared to isocaloric diets of different composition. Two laws of thermodynamics are relevant to the systems considered in nutrition and, whereas the first law is a conservation (of energy) law, the second is a dissipation law: something (negative entropy) is lost and therefore balance is not to be expected in diet interventions. Here, we propose that a misunderstanding of the second law accounts for the controversy about the role of macronutrient effect on weight loss and we review some aspects of elementary thermodynamics. We use data in the literature to show that thermogenesis is sufficient to predict metabolic advantage. Whereas homeostasis ensures balance under many conditions, as a general principle, "a calorie is a calorie" violates the second law of thermodynamics.}

  abstract = {Muscles produce force and power by utilizing chemical energy through ATP hydrolysis. During concentric contractions (shortening), muscles generate less force compared to isometric contractions, but consume greater amounts of energy as shortening velocity increases. Conversely, more force is generated and less energy is consumed during eccentric muscle contractions (lengthening). This relationship between force, energy use, and the velocity of contraction has important implications for understanding muscle efficiency, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this behavior remain poorly understood. Here we used spatially-explicit, multi-filament models of Ca2+-regulated force production within a half-sarcomere to simulate how force production, energy utilization, and the number of bound cross-bridges are affected by dynamic changes in sarcomere length. These computational simulations show that cross-bridge binding increased during slow-velocity concentric and eccentric contractions, compared to isometric contractions. Over the full ranges of velocities that we simulated, cross-bridge cycling and energy utilization (i.e. ATPase rates) increased during shortening, and decreased during lengthening. These findings are consistent with the Fenn effect, but arise from a complicated relationship between velocity-dependent cross-bridge recruitment and cross-bridge cycling kinetics. We also investigated how force production, power output, and energy utilization varied with cross-bridge and myofilament compliance, which is impossible to address under typical experimental conditions. These important simulations show that increasing cross-bridge compliance resulted in greater cross-bridge binding and ATPase activity, but less force was generated per cross-bridge and throughout the sarcomere. These data indicate that the efficiency of force production decreases in a velocity-dependent manner, and that this behavior is sensitive to cross-bridge compliance. In contrast, significant effects of myofilament compliance on force production were only observed during isometric contractions, suggesting that changes in myofilament compliance may not influence power output during non-isometric contractions as greatly as changes in cross-bridge compliance. These findings advance our understanding of how cross-bridge and myofilament properties underlie velocity-dependent changes in contractile efficiency during muscle movement.

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle is essential to maintain vital functions such as movement, breathing, and thermogenesis, and it is now recognized as an endocrine organ. Muscles release factors named my-okines, which can regulate several physiological processes. Moreover, skeletal muscle is particularly important in maintaining body homeostasis, since it is responsible for more than 75\% of all insulin-mediated glucose disposal. Alterations of skeletal muscle differentiation and function, with subse-quent dysfunctional expression and secretion of myokines, play a key role in the pathogenesis of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic diseases, finally leading to cardiometabolic complica-tions. Hence, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle function related to energy metabolism is critical for novel strategies to treat and prevent insulin resistance and its cardiometabolic complications. This review will be focused on both cellular and animal models currently available for exploring skeletal muscle metabolism and endocrine func-tion. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {A healthy lifestyle that includes physical activity has numerous positive effects on the mother and child during and after pregnancy. In this context physical activity plays a central role due to its influence on body composition. While visceral fatty tissue has a pro-inflammatory effect via so-called adipokines, myokines seem to have a more anti-inflammatory effect and thus prevent numerous diseases such as gestational hypertension or gestational diabetes. However, many women show a decreased level of physical activity during pregnancy when compared to pre-gestation levels. The reasons underlying this change are manifold and include concern about the effects of physical exertion on the unborn child. Gynaecologists and midwives are also often uncertain about what specific advice to give regarding physical activity. The present review describes, besides the underlying mechanisms, current physical activity recommendations and corresponding evidence with a focus on weight development in terms of obesity, gestational diabetes and foetal outcome. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a fast spreading virus leading to the development of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). Severe and critical cases are characterized by damage to the respiratory system, endothelial inflammation, and multiple organ failure triggered by an excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, culminating in the high number of deaths all over the world. Sedentarism induces worse, continuous, and progressive consequences to health. On the other hand, physical activity provides benefits to health and improves low-grade systemic inflammation. The aim of this review is to elucidate the effects of physical activity in physical fitness, immune defense, and its contribution to mitigate the severe inflammatory response mediated by SARS-CoV-2. Physical exercise is an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this sense, studies have shown that acute physical exercise induces the production of myokines that are secreted in tissues and into the bloodstream, supporting its systemic modulatory effect. Therefore, maintaining physical activity influence balance the immune system and increases immune vigilance, and also might promote potent effects against the consequences of infectious diseases and chronic diseases associated with the development of severe forms of COVID-19. Protocols to maintain exercise practice are suggested and have been strongly established, such as home-based exercise (HBE) and outdoor-based exercise (OBE). In this regard, HBE might help to reduce levels of physical inactivity, bed rest, and sitting time, impacting on adherence to physical activity, promoting all the benefits related to exercise, and attracting patients in different stages of treatment for COVID-19. In parallel, OBE must improve health, but also prevent and mitigate COVID-19 severe outcomes in all populations. In conclusion, HBE or OBE models can be a potent strategy to mitigate the progress of infection, and a coadjutant therapy for COVID-19 at all ages and different chronic conditions. © Copyright © 2021 Filgueira, Castoldi, Santos, de Amorim, de Sousa Fernandes, Anastácio, Campos, Santos and Souto.},

  abstract = {It is recognized that the path from physical inactivity and obesity to lifestyle-related diseases involves low-grade inflammation, indicated by elevated plasma levels of inflammatory markers. Interestingly, contracting skeletal muscle is a major source of circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to acute exercise, but with a markedly lower response in trained subjects. As C-reactive protein (CRP) is induced by IL-6, we hypothesized that basal levels of IL-6 and CRP reflect the degree of regular physical activity when compared with other markers of inflammation associated with lifestyle-related morbidity. Fasting plasma/serum levels of IL-6, IL-18, CRP, tumur necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble TNF receptor II (sTNF-RII), and adiponectin were measured in healthy non-diabetic men and women (n=84). The amount of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) was assessed by interview. Obesity was associated with elevated insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, IL-6, CRP, and adiponectin (all P{$<$}0.05). Importantly, physical inactivity was associated with elevated C-peptide (P=0.036), IL-6 (P=0.014), and CRP (P=0.007) independent of obesity, age, gender, and smoking. Furthermore, the LTPA score was inversely associated with IL-6 (P=0.017) and CRP (P=0.005), but with neither of the other markers. The results indicate that low levels of IL-6 and CRP - not IL-18, TNF-alpha, sTNF-RII, or adiponectin - reflect regular physical activity.},

  abstract = {Purpose. Augmented feedback is information that is inherently unavailable to a learner and must be provided by an outside source such as an expert or technical display. Such feedback may be divided into knowledge of performance, relating to movement quality, and knowledge of results (KR), relating to a movement outcome. KR has been examined with respect to variables such as timing, medium, and precision. In previous research involving a line-drawing task, individuals presented with higher levels of KR precision outperformed those presented with distracting feedback (nonsense syllables) or none. The present study sought to extend these findings by comparing the effects of KR types on learning a line-drawing task. Methods. On day 1, participants (n = 48) practised in 4 groups, receiving unique extrinsic feedback: control (no feedback), vague, precise, and visual feedback group. On day 2, learning was assessed via retention and transfer testing. Results. For acquisition, a repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a main effect for block in absolute constant error and variable error (p {$<$} 0.01), indicating improved accuracy and consistency with practice. During testing, results showed a main effect such that accuracy and consistency during retention were better than transfer (p {$<$} 0.01). Follow-up pairwise comparisons indicated significantly better performance for the visual feedback group when compared with the control group (p = 0.021). Conclusions. These results suggest that learning a simple task such as line-drawing may improve through verbal or visual feedback and that the latter medium may be an effective alternative to feedback that is presented verbally.

  abstract = {Despite strong scientific evidence supporting the benefits of regular exercise for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD), physical inactivity is highly prevalent worldwide. In addition to merely changing well-known risk factors for systemic CVD, regular exercise can also improve cardiovascular health through non-traditional mechanisms. Understanding the pathways through which exercise influences different physiological systems is important and might yield new therapeutic strategies to target pathophysiological mechanisms in CVD. This Review includes a critical discussion of how regular exercise can have antiatherogenic effects in the vasculature, improve autonomic balance (thereby reducing the risk of malignant arrhythmias), and induce cardioprotection against ischaemia–reperfusion injury, independent of~effects on traditional CVD risk factors. This Review also describes how exercise promotes a healthy anti-inflammatory milieu (largely through the release of muscle-derived myokines), stimulates myocardial regeneration, and ameliorates age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, a frequently overlooked non-traditional CVD risk factor. Finally, we discuss how the benefits of exercise might also occur via promotion of a healthy gut microbiota. We argue, therefore, that a holistic view of all body systems is necessary and useful when analysing the role of exercise in cardiovascular health. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.}

  abstract = {How specific coping strategies are associated with short-term outcomes among athletes after knee surgery is unknown. To determine whether (1) specific coping strategies were associated with return to sport, satisfaction, self-reported knee function, or kinesiophobia after sport-related knee surgery and (2) these associations varied by age, sex, or surgical procedure. Case series. Athletes (N = 184; men: n = 104, women: n = 80; aged {$<$} 20 years: n = 38; aged 20–25 years: n = 35; aged 26–31 years: n = 36; aged 32–40 years: n = 36; aged {$>$}40 years: n = 39) who underwent outpatient knee surgery at a single center were enrolled. Use of specific coping strategies (self-distraction, venting, acceptance, positive reframing, emotional support, and instrumental support) was assessed preoperatively with the Brief-Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory. Relationships among coping strategies and postoperative satisfaction, return to sport, International Knee Documentation Committee–Subjective and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia scores at a median 10.7 months follow-up were determined with consideration for age, sex, and surgical procedure. Return to the prior level of sport was 72\%, and satisfaction was 86\%. Most coping strategies had age-specific utilization rates; positive reframing was used least frequently in individuals aged {$<$} 20 years. Satisfaction increased with greater positive reframing among those aged {$<$} 20 years and decreased with greater self-distraction among men. Return to sport was higher with greater positive reframing in people aged {$<$} 32 years. No coping strategies predicted International Knee Documentation Committee–Subjective scores. Greater positive reframing correlated with less kinesiophobia in individuals aged {$<$} 20 years and greater instrumental support with less kinesiophobia in those aged {$>$}40 years. No other coping strategies were associated with outcomes. The surgical procedure was not related to an association between coping strategies and outcomes. Coping strategies had age-specific associations with outcomes after knee surgery in athletes. Positive reframing was infrequently used in younger athletes. Greater use of positive reframing in this group may improve return to sport and satisfaction and reduce fear of reinjury. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Twenty-four males (age mean 21 +/- 0.3 years) performed a standardised 10 min jogging warm-up followed by either; no stretching (NS), slow dynamic stretching at 50 b/min (SDS) or fast dynamic stretching at 100 b/min (FDS). Post-warm-up, squat, countermovement and depth jumps were performed. Heart rate, tympanic temperature, electromyography (EMG) and kinematic data (100 Hz) were collected during each jump. Results indicated that the FDS condition showed significantly greater jump height in all tests compared to the SDS and NS conditions. Further, the SDS trial resulted in significantly greater performance in the drop and squat jump compared to the NS condition. The reasons behind these performance changes are multi-faceted, but appear to be related to increases in heart rate and core temperature with slow dynamic stretches, while the greater increase in performance for the fast dynamic stretch intervention is linked to greater nervous system activation, shown by significant increases in EMG. In conclusion, a faster dynamic stretch component appears to prepare an athlete for a more optimum performance.},

  abstract = {The scientific interest in irisin, a myokine discovered in 2012, has grown exponentially in recent years. Irisin, which is mainly produced in skeletal muscle, influences the browning process of adipose tissue and lipid and energy metabolism. Recent discoveries highlight that the potential of this hormone may have been underestimated. In the first part of this review, reports on irisin structure and molecules involved in its metabolic pathway are shown. Furthermore, data related to unclear aspects are also reported: distribution, different gene expression of its precursors in different tissues, physiological levels of circulating irisin, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. The second part of this work focuses on exogenous stimuli and pharmacological agents which regulate the metabolic pathway of irisin and its serum concentration. In addition to physical exercise and exposure to low temperatures, which were early recognized as exogenous stimuli able to promote the production of this myokine, preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrates the ability of natural and synthetic molecules to interfere with this metabolic pathway. Current experimental data on irisin cannot dissolve all doubts related to this interesting molecule, but they certainly underline its potential for therapeutic purposes. Thus, identification of new pharmacological tools able to act on the irisin pathway is a challenging issue for biomedical research. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate increased prevalence of subcortical hyperintense white matter (HWM) lesions in hypobaric physiology technicians. BACKGROUND: Repetitive exposure to very high altitudes leads to persistent HWM signal change on Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI and impacts cognition in U-2 pilots. Hypobaric physiology technicians are also routinely exposed to very-low-pressure conditions, and we postulated that they would demonstrate similar MRI abnormalities. DESIGN/METHODS: We compared 36 physiology technicians with at least 50 exposures to altitudes above 20,000ft to 67 age-matched, healthy, active duty Air Force officers without history of neurologic disease. 3D FLAIR MRI high-resolution (isotropic 800μm) data acquired on a 3T Siemens scanner was analyzed for HWM lesions. Quantitative measurement of HWM lesions was performed as previously described. Data was analyzed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. We considered a p≤0.05 significant and 0.10≥p{$>$}0.05 as suggesting a trend towards significance. RESULTS: All participants underwent MRI. Data compared between hypobaric physiology technicians and Air Force officers, respectively: HWM subcortical volume (0.179cc±0.576; 0.040cc±0.044; p=0.073); HWM subcortical count (8.19±14.31; 3.30±4.28; p=0.045), total FLAIR volume (0.377cc±0.592; 0.592cc±0.142; p=0.378), and total ependymal volume (0.199cc±0.089; 0.215cc±0.111; p=0.614). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a trend towards increased volume and number of subcortical HWM lesions in physiology technicians occupationally exposed to extremely high altitudes, similar to that observed in U-2 pilots. Based on lesion distribution, we postulate an underlying inflammatory vs. enhanced thrombotic process, possibly secondary to venous nitrogen bubble formation, rather than direct gas bubble occlusion of an arterial vessel. Further investigation of mechanism of injury and extent of cognitive effects of such lesions is warranted. Future directions of this project include analysis of overlying cortical thickness, fractional anisotropy of white matter tracts, spectroscopy analysis, and serological biomarker assay.

  abstract = {The ageing process is characterized by a decline in muscle mass and strength, when this process outreaches pathological levels it is defined sarcopenia. This condition is associated with greater likelihood of recurrent falls and greater risk of mortality and less consistently associated with risk of hip fracture and functional limitation. On the other hand, ageing heavily affects bone inducing changes in bone structure-progressive decrease in trabecular thickness and increase in cortical porosity-, loss of bone mass and increase in bone turnover. There is an important interplay between muscle and skeletal systems: muscle contractions during anti-gravitational and physical activities apply mechanical stress to bones, influencing bone density, strength and microarchitecture, thus a decrease in muscle function is related to lower bone strength and predisposes to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis and sarcopenia show multiple common pathogenetic pathways, both systemic and local: reduction in anabolic hormones, chronic inflammatory condition, inactivity. In particular, several skeletal muscle-derived cytokines are able to directly influence bone. Vitamin D adequate levels are crucial for both bone and muscle function. Musculoskeletal impairment causes an important burden of disability and disease in older patients, a better understanding of pathogenesis and muscle-bone crosstalk could lead to improve prevention strategies and therapeutic options. © 2016, Pacini Editore S.p.A.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prime focus of research on sports injury has been on physical factors. This is despite our understanding that when an athlete sustains an injury it has psychosocial as well as physical impacts. Psychosocial factors have been suggested as prognostic influences on the outcomes of rehabilitation. The aim of this work was to address the question: are psychosocial factors associated with sports injury rehabilitation outcomes in competitive athletes? STUDY DESIGN: Mixed studies systematic review (PROSPERO reg.CRD42014008667). METHOD: Electronic database and bibliographic searching was undertaken from the earliest entry until 1 June 2015. Studies that included injured competitive athletes, psychosocial factors and a sports injury rehabilitation outcome were reviewed by the authors. A quality appraisal of the studies was undertaken to establish the risk of reporting bias. RESULTS: 25 studies were evaluated that included 942 injured competitive athletes were appraised and synthesised. Twenty studies had not been included in previous reviews. The mean methodological quality of the studies was 59\% (moderate risk of reporting bias). Convergent thematic analysis uncovered three core themes across the studies: (1) emotion associated with rehabilitation outcomes; (2) cognitions associated with rehabilitation outcomes; and (3) behaviours associated with rehabilitation outcomes. Injury and performance-related fears, anxiety and confidence were associated with rehabilitation outcomes. There is gender-related, age-related and injury-related bias in the reviewed literature. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial factors were associated with a range of sports injury rehabilitation outcomes. Practitioners need to recognise that an injured athlete's thoughts, feelings and actions may influence the outcome of rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Irisin is a recently discovered myokine that increases adipocyte metabolism, induces further “browning” of white adipose tissue, and enhances glucose metabolism. No study has ever determined how an acute bout of exercise impacts immediate post-exercise irisin concentration using a meta-analytic approach. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of an acute bout of exercise on the magnitude of post-exercise irisin concentration in adults using meta-analytic procedures. Searches were performed on PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, SCOPUS, and SPORTDiscus databases. Effect summaries were obtained using random-effects models. Random-effects single and multiple meta-regressions were performed to determine relationships between, and potential confounding effects of, variables of interest. Ten articles were retained for the final meta-analysis, producing 21 study estimates. An acute bout of exercise was accompanied by a post-exercise average increase in irisin concentration of 15.0 (95\% CI: 10.8\%-19.3\%). There was no significant relationship between post-exercise irisin concentration and age, intensity of aerobic exercise, or type of exercise training session (resistance vs aerobic training). Fitness level and body mass index were identified as significant predictive variables for post-exercise irisin concentration. However, a multiple meta-regression model identified fitness level as the single best predictor, with being fit (21.1\%±2.2\%) associated with a nearly twofold increase in post-exercise irisin concentration, compared with being unfit (11.8\%±2.1\%). Immediately following an acute bout of exercise, irisin concentration increases substantially in adults, with fitness level as an important modifier for the effect. © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of psychological safety in explaining the impact of identity leadership on team performance and athlete well-being. Adopting a cross-sectional survey design, 289 handball players rated the identity leadership skills of their coach, their captain, and the informal leaders in the team, as well as various performance- and well-being-related measures. Structural equation modelling (controlling for the nested structure of our data) revealed that by demonstrating identity leadership, coaches, captains, and in particular informal athlete leaders, all had a unique contribution in strengthening their team members’ identification with their team. By this shared sense of ‘us’, athletes felt psychologically safe in their team to speak up, provide input, and take risks. In line with our hypotheses, this sense of psychological safety acted as a mediator between identity leadership and two subsequent pathways: (1) a team-oriented pathway in which psychological safety inspired good teamwork, which fostered team resilience and, in turn, enhanced athletes’ satisfaction with their team’s performance; and (2) an individual-oriented pathway wherein psychological safety buffered against athletes’ burnout, thereby enhancing their health. In addition to these pathways mediated by psychological safety, the informal leaders directly influenced the performance pathway (with total effect sizes being 10 times larger than those of coaches and team captains), whereas coaches had a direct influence on the health pathway (with total effect sizes being three times larger than those of informal leaders and captains). Given the often-underestimated importance of the informal leaders, sport teams can be recommended to adopt a structure of shared leadership in which team members are encouraged to engage in identity leadership. In conclusion, we found that by nurturing a shared sense of ‘we’ and ‘us’ within the team, leaders are able to foster a psychologically safe environment, which in turn paves the way for an optimal team functioning and a healthier team.},

  abstract = {New Findings What is the central question of this study? What are the independent effects of hypoxia and hypocapnia on cerebral haemodynamics and cognitive function? What is the main finding and its importance? Exposure to hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia causes cognitive impairment in both normoxia and hypoxia. In addition, supplementation of carbon dioxide during hypoxia alleviates the cognitive impairment and reverses hypocapnia-induced vasoconstriction of the cerebrovasculature. These data provide new evidence for the independent effect of hypocapnia on the cognitive impairment associated with hypoxia. Abstract Hypoxia, which is accompanied by hypocapnia at altitude, is associated with cognitive impairment. This study examined the independent effects of hypoxia and hypocapnia on cognitive function and assessed how changes in cerebral haemodynamics may underpin cognitive performance outcomes. Single reaction time (SRT), five-choice reaction time (CRT) and spatial working memory (SWM) tasks were completed in 20 participants at rest and after 1 h of isocapnic hypoxia (IH, end-tidal oxygen partial pressure () = 45 mmHg, end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure () clamped at normal) and poikilocapnic hypoxia (PH, = 45 mmHg, not clamped). A subgroup of 10 participants were also exposed to euoxic hypocapnia (EH, = 100 mmHg, clamped 8 mmHg below normal). Middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) and prefrontal cerebral haemodynamics were measured with transcranial Doppler and near infrared spectroscopy, respectively. IH did not affect SRT and CRT performance from rest (566 ± 50 and 594 ± 70 ms), whereas PH (721 ± 51 and 765 ± 48 ms) and EH (718 ± 55 and 755 ± 34 ms) slowed response times (P {$<$} 0.001 vs. IH). Performance on the SWM task was not altered by condition. MCAv increased during IH compared to PH (P {$<$} 0.05), which was unchanged from rest. EH caused a significant fall in MCAv and prefrontal cerebral oxygenation (P {$<$} 0.05 vs. baseline). MCAv was moderately correlated to cognitive performance (R2 = 0.266–0.289), whereas prefrontal cerebral tissue perfusion and saturation were not (P {$>$} 0.05). These findings reveal a role of hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia per se on the development of cognitive impairment during normoxic and hypoxic exposures.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle has attracted attention as endocrine organ, because exercise-dependent cytokines called myokines/exerkines are released from skeletal muscle and are involved in systemic functions. While, local mechanical loading to skeletal muscle by exercise or resistance training alters myofiber type and size and myonuclear number. Skeletal muscle-resident stem cells, known as muscle satellite cells (MuSCs), are responsible for the increased number of myonuclei. Under steady conditions, MuSCs are maintained in a mitotically quiescent state but exit from that state and start to proliferate in response to high physical activity. Alterations in MuSC behavior occur when myofibers are damaged, but the lethal damage to myofibers does not seem to evoke mechanical loading-dependent MuSC activation and proliferation. Given that MuSCs proliferate without damage, it is unclear how the different behaviors of MuSCs are controlled by different physical activities. Recent studies demonstrated that myonuclear number reflects the size of myofibers; hence, it is crucial to know the properties of MuSCs and the mechanism of myonuclear accretion by MuSCs. In addition, the elucidation of mechanical load-dependent changes in muscle resident cells, including MuSCs, will be necessary for the discovery of new myokines/exerkines and understating skeletal muscle diseases. © 2021 Korean Endocrine Society.

Cerebral hypoxia impairs cognitive function and exercise performance and may result in brain damage. Residents at high altitude, in particular those with high‐altitude pulmonary hypertension, are prone to hypoxaemia due to the exposure to reduced barometric pressure and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Whether highlanders have a reduced cerebral oxygenation has not been studied.                                                                                  What is the main finding and its importance?                                          We found that despite a reduced arterial oxygen saturation, healthy highlanders and even those with pulmonary hypertension have a similar cerebral oxygenation to healthy lowlanders, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms protect long‐term residents at high altitude from cerebral hypoxia.                                                                                                                            High‐altitude pulmonary hypertension (HAPH), a chronic altitude‐related illness, causes hypoxaemia and impaired exercise performance. We evaluated the hypothesis that haemodynamic limitation and hypoxaemia in patients with HAPH are associated with impaired cerebral tissue oxygenation (CTO) compared with healthy highlanders (HH) and lowlanders (LL). We studied 36 highlanders with HAPH and 54 HH at an altitude of 3250~m, and 34 LL at 760~m. Mean(±SD) pulmonary artery pressures were 34(±3), 22(±5) and 16(±4) mmHg, respectively (                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05, all comparisons). The CTO was monitored by near‐infrared spectroscopy along with pulse oximetry (peripheral arterial oxygen saturation,                                  ) during quiet breathing of room air (RA) and oxygen for 20~min each, and during hyperventilation with RA and oxygen, respectively. In HAPH, HH and LL breathing RA,                                  was 88(±4), 92(±2) and 95(±2)\%, respectively (                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.001, all comparisons), and CTO was similar in the three groups, at 68(±3), 68(±4) and 69(±4)\%, respectively (n.s., all comparisons). Breathing oxygen increased                                  and CTO significantly more in HAPH than in HH and LL. Hyperventilation (RA) did not reduce CTO in HAPH but did in HH and LL; hyperventilation (oxygen) increased CTO in HAPH only. Highlanders with and without HAPH studied at 3250~m had a similar CTO to healthy lowlanders at 760~m even though highlanders were hypoxaemic. The physiological response to hyperoxia and hypocapnia assessed by cerebral near‐infrared spectroscopy suggests that healthy highlanders and even highlanders with HAPH effectively maintain an adequate CTO. This adaptation may be of particular relevance because adequate cerebral oxygenation is essential for vital brain functions.},

Irisin, resulting from the cleavage of the membrane protein FNDC5, was shown to induce adipocyte browning, with increased lipid oxidation and thermogenesis. Myonectin was only recently discovered and initial studies revealed a role in fatty acid uptake and oxidation in adipose tissue and liver. However, the mechanisms of their regulation by exercise are not entirely established. Impaired secretion and action of myokines, such as irisin and myonectin, may have a role in the establishment of insulin resistance. On the other hand, several studies have shown that insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle may change myokines expression and secretion. This may have consequences on lipid and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue and lead to a vicious cycle between impaired myokines production and insulin resistance. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the influence of skeletal muscle insulin resistance on the secretion of irisin and myonectin, as well as its impact on adipose tissue metabolism. © 2015 Luis Gamas et al.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to determine in subjects born at high altitude who move to sea level (HA-SL: born at 3500 m or above; n = 25) whether their cardiorespiratory responses to hypoxia and exercise are similar to those of sea level natives (SL,n = 25). The average age (39 ± 7.3 yr), weight (72 ± 7.3 kg), and height (1.71 ± 0.01 m) did not differ between the SL and HA-SL subjects. All subjects were studied at rest or during exercise (60 W on cycle ergometer) while breathing room air (FIO2 = 0.21 and PB = 760) or hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.115 and PB = 760) in the following order: (1) normoxia at rest (NX-Rs), (2) hypoxia at rest (HX-Rs, 11.5\% O2), hypoxia at exercise (HX-Ex), and normoxia at exercise (NX-Ex). Each period lasted 5 min. In absolute values, HA-SL showed significantly higher ventilation (VE, L/min) during exercise in both normoxia and hypoxia and higher oxygen saturation (SaO2, \%) during hypoxia both at rest and in exercise. They also had lower end-tidal CO2 values (PETCO2, torr) at rest in both normoxia and hypoxia, but a higher PETCO2 in hypoxic exercise. Heart rate (HR, beats/min) was lower at rest in both normoxia and hypoxia, but higher in exercise. With acute hypoxia, SaO2 decreased less in the HA-SL than in the SL at rest (HA-SL, 9.2 ± 0.8; SL, 12.0 ± 0.82) and during exercise (HA-SL, 18.3 ± 1.1; SL, 21.2 ± 1.2). In conclusion, this study shows that HA-SL natives have increased ventilation and heart rate during exercise once their lifelong hypoxia is relieved.}

  abstract = {Monitoring session training load to optimize the training stress that drives athlete adaptation and subsequent performance, is fundamental to periodization and programming. Analyzing the internal load experienced by the individual in response to the external load prescribed by coaching staff is crucial to avoid overtraining and optimize training adaptation. Subjective measures provide more information regarding individual training load, as heart rate measures alone do not account for collisions, eccentric muscle actions, muscle soreness, weather conditions, or accumulated training loads, which are paramount to the athlete experience. However, the current subjective metric for interpreting session training load (sRPE) is poorly shaped to the athlete's global response to the whole session, often showing poorer correlations to heart rate (HR) measures during intermittent or high-intensity activity. This study introduces a new metric, the Global Session Metric Score (GSMs), which creates a symmetrical relation between the verbal descriptor and numeric values, as well as more applicable session-specific verbal descriptors for the highest level of exertion. Twenty-four D1 male college soccer field players (age: 20.5 +/– 1.42) wore HR monitors and reported GSMs for all practices and games within an entire season. Linear regression with 10-fold cross validation was used to test the relation between GSMs with B-TRIMP and E-TRIMP, respectively. These models demonstrate good performance with consistency and reliability in the estimation of GSMs to predict both B-TRIMP (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.75–0.77) and E-TRIMP (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.76–0.78). The findings show promise for the GSMs index as a reliable means for measuring load in both training and matches during a high-intensity intermittent team sport. Future studies should directly compare GSMs to the existing sRPE scale within a controlled laboratory setting and across various other sports. GSMs provides coaches and clinicians a simple and cost-effective alternative to heart rate monitors, as well as a proficient measure of internal training load experienced by the individual.},

  abstract = {Due to its mass, skeletal muscle is the major site of glucose uptake and an important tissue in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Muscles of patients with T2D are affected with insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction, which result in impaired glucose and fatty acid metabolism. A well-established method of managing the muscle metabolic defects occurring in T2D is physical exercise. During exercise, muscles contract and secrete factors called myokines which can act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to improve muscle energy metabolism. In patients with T2D, plasma levels as well as muscle levels (mRNA and protein) of some myokines are upregulated, while others are downregulated. The signalling pathways of certain myokines are also altered in skeletal muscle of patients with T2D. Taken together, these findings suggest that myokine secretion is an important factor contributing to the development of muscle metabolic defects during T2D. It is also of interest considering that lack of physical activity is closely linked to the occurrence of this disease. The causal relationships between sedentary behavior, factors secreted by skeletal muscle at rest and during contraction and the development of T2D remain to be elucidated. Many myokines shown to influence muscle energy metabolism still have not been characterized in the context of T2D in skeletal muscle specifically. The purpose of this review is to highlight what is known and what remains to be determined regarding myokine secretion in patients with T2D to uncover potential therapeutic targets for the management of this disease. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS},

  abstract = {Adolescent athletes can use psychological skills immediately after being taught, but a dearth of empirical evidence exists regarding whether these skills are maintained over time. A 12-week curriculum (i.e., UNIFORM; Gilbert, 2011) was taught to a high school varsity soccer team with three data collection points: pretest, posttest, 4-week follow-up. Use of several skills was significantly greater posttest compared with pretest as measured by the Test of Performance Strategies (Thomas, Murphy, \& Hardy, 1999). Follow-up results were also salient. Relaxation, imagery, and self-talk use in practice was significantly greater than pretest at followup; relaxation, imagery, goal setting, and self-talk in competition showed similar results. Descriptive statistics and qualitative data triangulate these results. The UNIFORM curriculum enabled the athletes to use the skills more consistently. This study makes a contribution by measuring the skills at follow-up and providing evidence of their continued use four weeks after the curriculum's conclusion. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

Studies in experimental animals have shown that BAT is a site of energy expenditure, and that BAT activity protects against obesity and associated metabolic diseases. The action of the sympathetic nervous activity on BAT depots is considered the main regulator of BAT activity in rodent models and possibly also in humans. However, recent research has revealed the existence of additional hormonal factors, produced by distinct peripheral tissues or present in the diet, that influence the amount and activity of BAT. These hormonal factors may act on BAT directly, but also indirectly by targeting the brain and determining the intensity of sympathetic action upon BAT. Identification and characterization of novel factors that control BAT may provide clues for the development of new strategies to treat obesity and metabolic diseases. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Exercise is an established and essential component of lifestyle modification for NAFLD disease management. Despite numerous studies reporting exercise-mediated improvements in NAFLD, there remains a large gap in our knowledge of how to optimize exercise prescriptions and whether the benefits of exercise extend beyond improvements in liver fat. In this review, we summarize studies that have investigated the independent effects of exercise training on liver enzymes, hepatic fat, and histologic markers in NAFLD. Overall, 12-weeks of aerobic, resistance, the combination of aerobic and resistance, and novel training modalities, including acceleration and hybrid training, significantly improve liver enzymes and hepatic fat. The greatest benefits in NAFLD may occur through the combination of aerobic and resistance training that targets both cardiorespiratory fitness, and mediators of skeletal muscle, known as myokines. Understanding the role of myokines in the beneficial effects of exercise in NAFLD may identify future therapeutic targets that can be modified with tailored exercise prescriptions. © 2017 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Introduction A previous study has suggested that the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele DQB1*06:02 affects hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) but not hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) in an Asian population. The current study evaluated the relationship in Caucasians and Asians. In addition we assessed whether gender or polymorphisms in genes participating in the control of breathing affect HVR and HCVR. Methods A re-breathing system was used to measure HVR and HCVR in 551 young adults (56.8\% Caucasians, 30\% Asians). HLA-DQB1*06:02 and tagged polymorphisms and coding variants in genes participating in breathing (PHOX2B, GPR4 and TASK2/KCNK5) were analyzed. The associations between HVR/HCVR and HLA-DQB1*06:02, genetic polymorphisms, and gender were evaluated using ANOVA or frequentist association testing with SNPTEST. Results HVR and gender are strongly correlated. HCVR and gender are not. Mean HVR in women was 0.276±0.168 (liter/minute/\%SpO2) compared to 0.429±0.266 (liter/minute/\%SpO2) in men, p{$<$}0.001 (55.4\% higher HVR in men). Women had lower baseline minute ventilation (8.08±2.36 l/m vs. 10.00±3.43l/m, p{$<$}0.001), higher SpO2 (98.0±1.3\% vs. 96.6±1.7\%, p{$<$}0.001), and lower EtCO2 (4.65±0.68\% vs. 4.82±1.02\%, p = 0.025). One hundred and two (18.5\%) of the participants had HLA-DQB1*06:02. No association was seen between HLA-DQB1*06:02 and HVR or HCVR. Genetic analysis revealed point wise, uncorrected significant associations between two TASK2/KCNK5 variants (rs2815118 and rs150380866) and HCVR. Conclusions This is the largest study to date reporting the relationship between gender and HVR/ HCVR and the first study assessing the association between genetic polymorphisms in humans and HVR/HCVR. The data suggest that gender has a large effect on hypoxic breathing response.},

The ketogenic diet (KD) has demonstrated efficacy as a metabolic treatment for intractable epilepsy and other disorders but its effect on local brain oxygen levels is completely unknown. This study investigated the effects of the KD on tissue oxygenation in the hippocampus before and after electrically elicited (kindled) seizures and whether it could protect against a seizure-induced learning impairment. We also examined the effects of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as a potential underlying mechanism. Methods Male and female rats were given access to one of three diet protocols 2~weeks prior to the initiation of seizures: KD, caloric restricted standard chow, and ad libitum standard chow. Dorsal hippocampal oxygen levels were measured prior to initiation of diets as well as before and after a 10-day kindling paradigm. Male rats were then tested on a novel object recognition task to assess postictal learning impairments. In a separate cohort, BHB was administered 30~min prior to seizure elicitation to determine whether it influenced oxygen dynamics. Results The KD increased dorsal hippocampal oxygen levels, ameliorated postictal hypoxia, and prevented postictal learning impairments. Acute BHB administration did not alter oxygen levels before or after seizures. Interpretation The ketogenic diet raised brain oxygen levels and attenuated severe postictal hypoxia likely through a mechanism independent of ketosis and shows promise as a non-pharmacological treatment to prevent the postictal state.},

Novel exercise-inducible soluble factors, including myokines, hepatokines, and osteokines, and immune cytokines and adipokines are hypothesized to play an important role in the body’s response to exercise. To our knowledge, no review has provided a comprehensive integrative overview of these novel molecular players and the mechanisms involved in the redistribution of metabolic fuel during and after exercise, the loss of weight and fat mass, and reduced inflammation. In this review, we explain the potential role of these exercise-inducible factors, namely myokines, such as irisin, IL-6, IL-15, METRNL, BAIBA, and myostatin, and hepatokines, in particular selenoprotein P, fetuin A, FGF21, ANGPTL4, and follistatin. We also describe the function of osteokines, specifically osteocalcin, and of adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin. We also emphasize an integrative overview of the pleiotropic mechanisms, the metabolic pathways, and the inter-organ crosstalk involved in energy expenditure, fat mass loss, reduced inflammation, and healthy weight induced by exercise. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract = {Physical activity (PA) during pregnancy provides both maternal and fetal health benefits. It has been theorized that myokines, peptides secreted by contracting skeletal muscle, may play an important mechanistic role in facilitating the health benefits obtained from prenatal exercise. The objective of this review was to synthesize the current literature on the relationship between maternal PA and myokine response. A search strategy was developed using the terms pregnancy, PA, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and TNF-α. A systematic search was completed in July 2020, in Medline, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and in November 2020 for unpublished dissertations (grey literature; Proquest). Both human- and animal-based studies of any design were included, while commentaries and editorial articles were excluded. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers and summarized narratively. Data were thematically summarized based on the myokine and whether findings were from human or animal studies. Ten studies were included in this review. Findings from studies that examined IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α suggest a trimester-specific interaction between PA and myokine levels; no studies evaluated IL-13. Future research should investigate the PA-myokine relationship throughout all stages of gestation. © 2021 John Wiley \& Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

  abstract = {Obesity is now a worldwide epidemic. In recent years, different phenotypes of obesity, ranging from metabolically healthy normal weight to metabolically unhealthy obese, were described. Although there is no standardized definition for these phenotypes or for metabolic health, the influence of lifestyle and early-life factors is undisputed. In this context, the ratio of muscle-to-fat tissue seems to play a crucial role. Both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle are highly heterogeneous endocrine organs secreting several hormones, with myokines and adipokines being involved in local autocrine/paracrine interactions and crosstalk with other tissues. Some of these endocrine factors are secreted by both tissues and are, therefore, termed adipo-myokines. High (cardiorespiratory) fitness as a surrogate parameter for an active lifestyle is epidemiologically linked to “better” metabolic health, even in the obese; this may be partly due to the role of adipo-myokines and the crosstalk between adipose and muscle tissue. Therefore, it is essential to consider (cardiovascular) fitness in the definition of metabolically healthy obese/metabolic health and to perform longitudinal studies in this regard. A better understanding of both the (early-life) lifestyle factors and the underlying mechanisms that mediate different phenotypes is necessary for the tailored prevention and personalized treatment of obesity. © 2019 by the authors.

Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that bone is heavily influenced by soluble factors derived from skeletal muscle (i.e., muscle-to-bone communication). The purpose of this review is to discuss the regulation of bone remodeling (formation and/or resorption) through skeletal muscle-derived cytokines (hereafter myokines) including the anti-inflammatory cytokine METRNL and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, FGF-2 and others).

Tests for factorial invariance revealed that the three-factor model was an equally good fit for 9-11 year olds and 12-14 year olds, and for both males and females.

Worry about performing poorly was highest in girls and in older athletes, whereas boys reported higher levels of concentration disruption in competitive sport situations.

This paper provides an extensive review of available biosensing methods to implement the control system for transradial prostheses based on the measured activity in remnant muscles. Covered techniques include electromyography, magnetomyography, electrical impedance tomography, capacitance sensing, near‐infrared spectroscopy, sonomyography, optical myography, force myography, phonomyography, myokinetic control, and modern approaches to cineplasty. The paper also covers combinations of these approaches, which, in many cases, achieve better accuracy while mitigating the weaknesses of individual methods. The work is focused on the practical applicability of the approaches, and analyses present challenges associated with each technique along with their relationship with proprioceptive feedback, which is an important factor for intuitive control over the prosthetic device, especially for high dexterity prosthetic hands. © MDPI AG.

  abstract = {Physical activity improves the quality of life and decreases the risk of several diseases (i.e. stroke, hypertension, myocardial infarction, obesity, and malignancies). Skeletal muscles are considered as an endocrine organ that produces myokines characterized by a paracrine or endocrine activity. Irisin is a circulating hormone-like myokine and is secreted as a product of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 from skeletal muscle in response to exercise. This molecule regulates the energy metabolism and acts in adipose tissue, bones, and nervous system. As both animal and clinical studies confirmed the action of irisin in muscle and adipocytes, this protein is considered as adipomyokine. In adipose tissue, irisin stimulates the process of browning of beige precursor fat cells, which are present in white fat cells, and promotes energy expenditure. It affects bone metabolism by increasing osteoblast differentiation and reducing osteoclast maturation. In the nervous system, irisin influences hippocampal neurogenesis and neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells in mice and is considered as a messenger between exercise and brain function. However, the existence of this protein and its role in humans is a matter of debate. This study presents irisin as a new champion of the molecule, which could be considered as the messenger in the muscle-fat-bone-brain axis.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:~           Retrospective clinical trials of pulse oximeter accuracy report more frequent missed diagnoses of hypoxemia in hospitalized Black patients than White patients, differences that may contribute to racial disparities in health and health care. Retrospective studies have limitations including mistiming of blood samples and oximeter readings, inconsistent use of functional versus fractional saturation, and self-reported race used as a surrogate for skin color. Our objective was to prospectively measure the contributions of skin pigmentation, perfusion index (PI), sex, and age on pulse oximeter errors in a laboratory setting.           METHODS:~           We enrolled 146 healthy subjects, including 25 with light skin (Fitzpatrick class I and II), 78 with medium (class III and IV), and 43 with dark (class V and VI) skin. We studied 2 pulse oximeters (Nellcor N-595 and Masimo Radical 7) in prevalent clinical use. We analyzed 9763 matched pulse oximeter readings (pulse oximeter measured functional saturation [Spo2]) and arterial oxygen saturation (hemoximetry arterial functional oxygen saturation [Sao2]) during stable hypoxemia (Sao2 68\%–100\%). PI was measured as percent infrared light modulation by the pulse detected by the pulse oximeter probe, with low perfusion categorized as PI {$<$} 1\%. The primary analysis was to assess the relationship between pulse oximeter bias (difference between Sao2 and Spo2) by skin pigment category in a multivariable mixed-effects model incorporating repeated-measures and different levels of Sao2 and perfusion.           RESULTS:~           Skin pigment, PI, and degree of hypoxemia significantly contributed to errors (bias) in both pulse oximeters. For PI values of 1.0\% to 1.5\%, 0.5\% to 1.0\%, and {$<$}0.5\%, the P value of the relationship to mean bias or median absolute bias was {$<$}.00001. In lightly pigmented subjects, only PI was associated with positive bias, whereas in medium and dark subjects bias increased with both low perfusion and degree of hypoxemia. Sex and age was not related to pulse oximeter bias. The combined frequency of missed diagnosis of hypoxemia (pulse oximeter readings 92\%–96\% when arterial oxygen saturation was {$<$}88\%) in low perfusion conditions was 1.1\% for light, 8.2\% for medium, and 21.1\% for dark skin.           CONCLUSIONS:~           Low peripheral perfusion combined with darker skin pigmentation leads to clinically significant high-reading pulse oximeter errors and missed diagnoses of hypoxemia. Darkly pigmented skin and low perfusion states are likely the cause of racial differences in pulse oximeter performance in retrospective studies.

  abstract = {Approach: In recent years, the increase in the number of distance runners in various events worldwide has been evident. Evaluation and control of training with precise variables and easy applicability of the same variables are necessary. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the critical velocity and velocity at the anaerobic threshold of moderately trained runners at 5-km. Materials and Methods: A total of 19 male runners with a moderate level of performance participated in the study. The participants performed two procedures to determine the speed of the anaerobic treadmill threshold and the runway critical velocity (maximum performance test of 3000 m and 5000 m). To determine the velocity at the anaerobic threshold, individual blood lactate level assessment was used. For comparison, the t-test was used to determine the Cohen effect size, Pearson linear correlation, and Bland-Altman concordance. Results: The average values found in the treadmill anaerobic threshold velocity and the critical velocity were 13.75 ± 1.37 km/h and 13.70 ± 1.33 km/h, respectively. Identification of positive correlations between the blood lactate methods and the critical velocity was possible. Conclusion: The study found that the estimated threshold velocities in methods using blood lactate and indirect methods (critical velocity) are in agreement with each other. Therefore, the methods presented are safe for the training prescription. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

The participants who were 14-17 age range are licensed players of Amasya Tekhan Sports Club. The protocol employed by Gelen (2008) so as to investigate into the effects of different stretching protocols on the vertical jumping was utilised for tests. Vertical jump tests were conducted on participants three times following each stretching activity in 4-5 min and the best results were noted. Height, body weight and means of BMI, standart deviation, minimum and maximum values of the athletes were measured. A one-way variance analysis in repeated measures (ANOVA) was employed to analyze the data. Findings clearly indicate that neither static nor dynamic stretching exercises have an effect on jumping performance. Correspondingly, this finding may have caused from the physical and psyhological traits of taekwondo players. In summation, based on the analysis in this study, it can be concluded that static and dynamic stretching exercises done after slow aerobic runnings before jumping had no significant effect on front jumping (FJ), squat jumping (SJ) and drop jumping (DJ) performance.~ Article visualizations:},

  abstract = {Neuregulin was described initially as a neurotrophic factor involved in the formation of the neuromuscular junction in skeletal muscle. However, in recent years, neuregulin has been reported to be a myokine that exerts relevant effects on myogenesis and the regulation of muscle metabolism. In this new context, the rapid and chronic metabolic effects of neuregulin appear to be related to muscle contraction. Indeed, the effects of neuregulin resemble those of exercise, which are accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity. In this review, we challenge the classical role assigned to neuregulin in muscle and propound the emerging concept of its involvement in the regulation of energetic metabolism and insulin responsiveness.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Irisin is a newly discovered myokine, which is involved in energy metabolism and associated with "browning" of the white adipose tissue, obesity, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. It is still uncertain that whether irisin level is associated with coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between irisin levels and coronary artery disease. EVIDENCEACQUISITION: Asearch of PubMed, MEDLINE, Elsevier Science Direct, Springer, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for studies published from 2000 to 2017 was undertaken to identify relevant studies. Case-control studies that reported the association between irisin levels and coronary artery disease were included. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random-efforts models were used to analyze the weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95\% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analysis was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: From 741 studies, 7 case-control studies involving 867 patients and 700 controls were selected for meta-analysis based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. In these case-control studies, irisin concentrations were lower in coronary artery disease patients compared with healthy controls. In the meta-analysis, the pooled data indicated that irisin levels were -18.10 ng/mL ([95\% CI: -35.53 to -0.68 ng/mL]; P{$<$}0.05) lower in patients with cardiovascular disease or atherosclerosis than healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that irisin levels were significantly lower in patients with coronary artery disease. © 2017 EDIZIONIMINERVAMEDICA.},

Physical activity decreases the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is associated with better AD prognosis, and positively affects cognitive function in AD patients. Skeletal muscle is an important secretory organ, communicating proteotoxic and metabolic stress to distant tissues, including the CNS, through the secretion of bioactive molecules collectively known as myokines. Skeletal muscle undergoes significant physical and metabolic remodeling during exercise, including alterations in myokine expression profiles. This suggests that changes in myokine and myometabolite secretion may underlie the well-documented benefits of exercise in AD. However, to date, very few studies have focused on specific alterations in skeletal muscle-originating secreted factors and their potential neuroprotective effects in AD. In this review, we discuss exercise therapy for AD prevention and intervention, and propose the use of circulating myokines as novel therapeutic tools for modifying AD progression. © Copyright © 2021 Gupta, Khan and Cortes.},

Utilizing an in vitro circulation system, we studied performance of three pulse oximeters during hypoxemia and severe anemia. Three oximeters including one benchtop, one handheld, and one fingertip device were selected to reflect a range of cost and device types. Human blood was diluted to generate four hematocrit levels (40\%, 30\%, 20\%, and 10\%). Oxygen and nitrogen were bubbled through the blood to generate a range of oxygen saturations (O2Hb) and the blood was cycled through the in vitro circulation system. Pulse oximeter saturations (SpO2) were paired with simultaneously-measured O2Hb readings from a reference CO-oximeter. Data for each hematocrit level and each device were least-squares fit to a 2nd-order equation with quality of each curve fit evaluated using standard error of the estimate. Bias and average root mean square error were calculated after correcting for the calibration difference between human and in vitro circulation system calibration. The benchtop oximeter maintained good accuracy at all but the most extreme level of anemia. The handheld device was not as accurate as the benchtop, and inaccuracies increased at lower hematocrit levels. The fingertip device was the least accurate of the three oximeters. Pulse oximeter performance is impacted by severe anemia in vitro. The use of in vitro calibration systems may play an important role in augmenting in vivo performance studies evaluating pulse oximeter performance in challenging conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unexplained physiological events (PE), possibly related to hypoxia and hyperventilation, are a concern for some air forces. Physiological monitoring could aid research into PEs, with measurement of arterial oxygen saturation (S p o 2 ) often suggested despite potential limitations in its use. Given similar physiological responses to hypoxia and hyperventilation, the present study characterized the cardiovascular and respiratory responses to each. METHODS: Ten healthy subjects were exposed to 55 mins of normobaric hypoxia simulating altitudes of 0, 8000, and 12,000 ft (0, 2438, and 3658 m) while breathing normally and voluntarily hyperventilating (doubling minute ventilation). Respiratory gas analysis and spirometry measured end-tidal gases (P ET o 2 and P ET co 2 ) and minute ventilation. S p o 2 was assessed using finger pulse oximetry. Mean arterial, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were measured noninvasively. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Stroop test. RESULTS: Voluntary hyperventilation resulted in a doubling of minute ventilation and lowered P ET co 2 , while altitude had no effect on these. P ET o 2 and S p o 2 declined with increasing altitude. However, despite a significant drop in P ET o 2 of 15.2 mmHg from 8000 to 12,000 ft, S p o 2 was similar when hyperventilating (94.7 ± 2.3\% vs. 93.4 ± 4.3\%, respectively). The only cardiovascular response was an increase in heart rate while hyperventilating. Altitude had no effect on cognitive impairment, but hyperventilation did. DISCUSSION: For many cardiovascular and respiratory variables, there is minimal difference in responses to hypoxia and hyperventilation, making these challenging to differentiate. S p o 2 is not a reliable marker of environmental hypoxia in the presence of hyperventilation and should not be used as such without additional monitoring of minute ventilation and end-tidal gases.

  abstract = {Cancer cachexia is a progressive disorder characterized by body weight, fat, and muscle loss. Cachexia induces metabolic disruptions that can be analogous and distinct from those observed in cancer, obscuring both diagnosis and treatment options. Inflammation, hypogonadism, and physical inactivity are widely investigated as systemic mediators of cancer-induced muscle wasting. At the cellular level, dysregulation of protein turnover and energy metabolism can negatively impact muscle mass and function. Exercise is well known for its anti-inflammatory effects and potent stimulation of anabolic signaling. Emerging evidence suggests the potential for exercise to rescue muscle's sensitivity to anabolic stimuli, reduce wasting through protein synthesis modulation, myokine release, and subsequent downregulation of proteolytic factors. To date, there is no recommendation for exercise in the management of cachexia. Given its complex nature, a multimodal approach incorporating exercise offers promising potential for cancer cachexia treatment. This review's primary objective is to summarize the growing body of research examining exercise regulation of cancer cachexia. Furthermore, we will provide evidence for exercise interactions with established systemic and cellular regulators of cancer-induced muscle wasting. © 2020 The Authors},

Specifically, "The Biggest Loser" contestants engaged in large, sustained increases in physical activity that may have caused compensatory metabolic adaptations to substantially decrease resting metabolic rate and thereby minimize changes in total energy expenditure. This interpretation helps explain why the magnitude of persistent metabolic adaptation was largest in contestants with the greatest increases in sustained physical activity and why weight‐loss interventions involving lower levels of physical activity have not measured similarly large metabolic adaptations. Additional longitudinal studies quantifying the interrelationships between various components of energy expenditure and energy intake are needed to better understand the dynamics of human body weight regulation.

  abstract = {Recent studies clearly indicate that the endocrine function of the skeletal muscle is essential for a long and healthy life. Regular exercise, which has been shown to stimulate the release of myokines, lowers the risk of many diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, emphasizing the role of skeletal muscle in proper functioning of other tissues. In addition, exercise increases insulin sensitivity, which may also impact iron metabolism. Even though the role of iron in neurodegeneration is well established, the exact mechanisms of iron toxicity are not known. Interestingly, exercise has been shown to modulate iron metabolism, mainly by reducing body iron stores. Insulin signaling and iron metabolism are interconnected, as high tissue iron stores are associated with insulin resistance, and conversely, impaired insulin signaling may lead to iron accumulation in an affected tissue. Excess iron accumulation in tissue triggers iron-dependent oxidative stress. Further, iron overload in the skeletal muscle not only negatively affects muscle contractility but also might impact its endocrine function, thus possibly affecting the clinical outcome of diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss possible mechanisms of iron dependent oxidative stress in skeletal muscle, its impact on muscle mass and endocrine function, as well as on neurodegeneration processes. © Copyright © 2019 Halon-Golabek, Borkowska, Herman-Antosiewicz and Antosiewicz.},

The purpose of this study was to examine relative age effects in gymnastics, a sport where athletes reach peak performance during puberty. Examining the birthdates of 921 female gymnasts, we discovered no relative age effects for the collective sample. Dividing the sample into two groups, we noted a relative age effect for under-15 gymnasts, but a reverse effect for over-15 gymnasts. Inspecting competitive standards, we noted over-representations of over-15 athletes born in the fourth quartile at all standards except national. In the discussion, we highlight the complexity of relative age effects by incorporating deliberate practice and competition standard as variables for consideration.}

We examined the metabolic concomitants of these alterations in rats subjected to the same hypoxic insult. Hypoxic rats increased brain glucose and lactate concentrations and decreased brain glycogen. However, hypoxia had no significant effects on regional brain levels of ATP and phosphocreatine or on intracellular pH, indicating successful adaptation to the hypoxic insult. 2-Deoxyglucose studies showed that hypoxia increased the regional metabolic rate for glucose by 10?40\%. These results indicate increased glycolysis in the hypoxic rat brain, which probably underlies the increased density of glucose transporters in brain microvessels and the increased blood-to-brain glucose influx in hypoxia.}

  abstract = {Human evolution required adaptation to the boundary conditions of Earth, including 1 g gravity. The bipedal mobility of Homo sapiens in that gravitational field causes ground reaction force (GRF) loading of their lower extremities, influencing the integrity of the tissues of those extremities. However, humans usually experience such loading during the day and then a period of relative unloading at night. Many studies have indicated that loading of tissues and cells of the musculoskeletal (MSK) system can inhibit their responses to biological mediators such as cytokines and growth factors. Such findings raise the possibility that humans use such cycles of acute conditioning and deconditioning of the cells and tissues of the MSK system to elaborate critical mediators and responsiveness in parallel with these cycles, particularly involving GRF loading. However, humans also experience circadian rhythms with the levels of a number of mediators influenced by day/night cycles, as well as various levels of biological clocks. Thus, if responsiveness to MSK-generated mediators also occurs during the unloaded part of the daily cycle, that response must be integrated with circadian variations as well. Furthermore, it is also possible that responsiveness to circadian rhythm mediators may be regulated by MSK tissue loading. This review will examine evidence for the above scenario and postulate how interactions could be both regulated and studied, and how extension of the acute cycles biased towards deconditioning could lead to loss of tissue integrity. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract = {It has been well established in epidemiological studies and randomized controlled trials that habitual exercise is beneficial for brain health, such as cognition and mental health. Generally, it may be reasonable to say that the physiological benefits of acute exercise can prevent brain disorders in late life if such exercise is habitually/chronically conducted. However, the mechanisms of improvement in brain function via chronic exercise remain incompletely understood because such mechanisms are assumed to be multifactorial, such as the adaptation of repeated acute exercise. This review postulates that cerebral metabolism may be an important physiological factor that determines brain function. Among metabolites, the provision of lactate to meet elevated neural activity and regulate the cerebrovascular system and redox states in response to exercise may be responsible for exercise-enhanced brain health. Here, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the influence of exercise on brain health, particularly cognitive performance, with the underlying mechanisms by means of lactate. Regarding the influence of chronic exercise on brain function, the relevance of exercise intensity and modality, particularly high-intensity interval exercise, is acknowledged to induce “metabolic myokine” (i.e., lactate) for brain health. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Purpose: The main aim of this investigation was to quantify differences in sprint mechanical variables across sports and within each sport. Secondary aims were to quantify sex differences and relationships among the variables. Methods: In this cross-sectional study of elite athletes, 235 women (23 ± 5 y and 65 ± 7 kg) and 431 men (23 ± 4 y and 80 ± 12 kg) from 23 different sports (including 128 medalists from World Championships and/or Olympic Games) were tested in a 40-m sprint at the Norwegian Olympic Training Center between 1995 and 2018. These were pre-existing data from quarterly or semi-annual testing that the athletes performed for training purposes. Anthropometric and speed-time sprint data were used to calculate the theoretical maximal velocity, horizontal force, horizontal power, slope of the force-velocity relationship, maximal ratio of force, and index of force application technique. Results: Substantial differences in mechanical profiles were observed across sports. Athletes in sports in which sprinting ability is an important predictor of success (e.g., athletics sprinting, jumping and bobsleigh) produced the highest values for most variables, whereas athletes in sports in which sprinting ability is not as important tended to produce substantially lower values. The sex differences ranged from small to large, depending on variable of interest. Although most of the variables were strongly associated with 10- and 40-m sprint time, considerable individual differences in sprint mechanical variables were observed among equally performing athletes. Conclusions: Our data from a large sample of elite athletes tested under identical conditions provides a holistic picture of the force-velocity-power profile continuum in athletes. The data indicate that sprint mechanical variables are more individual than sport specific. The values presented in this study could be used by coaches to develop interventions that optimize the training stimulus to the individual athlete.

  abstract = {Purpose of review: To review original research studies and reviews that present data on adipocyte-myocyte crosstalk in the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance with a specific focus on thyroid hormone. Recent findings: Adipose tissue communicates with skeletal muscle not only through free fatty acids but also through secretion of various products called adipokines. Adipokines came out as governors of insulin sensitivity and are deregulated in obesity. In addition to well known leptin, adiponectin, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, newer adipokines like retinol-binding protein 4 have been associated with insulin resistance. There is mounting evidence that not only adipose tissue but also skeletal muscle produces and secretes biologically active proteins or 'myokines' that facilitate metabolic crosstalk between organ systems. In recent years, increased expression of myostatin, a secreted anabolic inhibitor of muscle growth and development, has been associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism affect insulin sensitivity in multiple ways that might overlap adipocyte-myocyte crosstalk. Recent studies have provided new insights in effects of processing of the parent hormone T4 to the active T3 at the level of the skeletal muscle. Summary: Adipocyte-myocyte crosstalk is an important modulator in the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Thyroid disorders are very common and may have detrimental effects on skeletal muscle insulin resistance, potentially by interacting with adipocyte-myocyte crosstalk. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health.

  abstract = {Exercise has many potential benefits in relation to cancer. Apart from primary prevention, these include improvement of nonspecific cancer-related symptoms, amelioration of symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors related to cancer treatment, and improvements in various quality-of-life-related factors. Increasing evidence also points toward improved cancer-free and overall survival in cancer patients who undertake regular exercise, findings which should encourage further research in this area. Obesity is known to be associated with a proinflammatory, prothrombotic humoral milieu, which may promote aggressiveness in prostate cancer through interactions with NK-cell-mediated killing of circulating tumor cells, through platelet-circulating tumor cell interactions, and through alterations in adipokine and myokine profile among others. Physical activity reduces levels of systemic inflammatory mediators and so exercise may represent an accessible and cost-effective means of ameliorating the proinflammatory effects of obesity in cancer patients.

  abstract = {Osteoporosis and sarcopenia are two age-related diseases that affect the quality of life in the elderly. Initially, they were thought to be two independent diseases; however, recently, increasing basic and clinical data suggest that skeletal muscle and bone are both spatially and metabolically connected. The term “osteosarcopenia” is used to define a condition of synergy of low bone mineral density with muscle atrophy and hypofunction. Bone and muscle cells secrete several factors, such as cytokines, myokines, and osteokines, into the circulation to influence the biological and pathological activities in local and distant organs and cells. Recent studies reveal that extracellular vesicles containing microRNAs derived from senescent skeletal muscle and bone cells can also be transported and aid in regulating bone-muscle crosstalk. In this review, we summarize the age-related changes in the secretome and extracellular vesicle-microRNAs secreted by the muscle and bone, and discuss their interactions between muscle and bone cells during aging. © Copyright © 2020 He, He, Hou, Chen, Huang, Yang, Luo and Li.},

  abstract = {IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a wide range of biologic effects. In response to prolonged exercise, IL-6 is synthesized by contracting skeletal muscle and released into circulation. Circulating IL-6 is thought to maintain energy status during exercise by acting as an energy sensor for contracting muscle and stimulating glucose production. If tissue damage occurs, immune cells infiltrate and secrete cytokines, including IL-6, to repair skeletal muscle damage. With adequate rest and nutrition, the IL-6 response to exercise is attenuated as skeletal muscle adapts to training. However, sustained elevations in IL-6 due to repeated bouts of unaccustomed activities or prolonged exercise with limited rest may result in untoward physiologic effects, such as accelerated muscle proteolysis and diminished nutrient absorption, and may impair normal adaptive responses to training. Recent intervention studies have explored the role of mixed meals or carbohydrate, protein, ω-3 fatty acid, or antioxidant supplementation in mitigating exercise-induced increases in IL-6. Emerging evidence suggests that sufficient energy intake before exercise is an important factor in attenuating exercise-induced IL-6 by maintaining muscle glycogen. We detail various nutritional interventions that may affect the IL-6 response to exercise in healthy human adults and provide recommendations for future research exploring the role of IL-6 in the adaptive response to exercise. © FASEB.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine the effects of stretching before and after exercising on muscle soreness after exercise, risk of injury, and athletic performance. Method: Systematic review. Data sources: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies identified by searching Medline, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and PEDro, and by recursive checking of bibliographies. Main outcome measures: Muscle soreness, incidence of injury, athletic performance. Results: Five studies, all of moderate quality, reported sufficient data on the effects of stretching on muscle soreness to be included in the analysis. Outcomes seemed homogeneous. Stretching produced small and statistically non-significant reductions in muscle soreness. The pooled estimate of reduction in muscle soreness 24 hours after exercising was only 0.9 mm on a 100 mm scale (95\% confidence interval −2.6 mm to 4.4 mm). Data from two studies on army recruits in military training show that muscle stretching before exercising does not produce useful reductions in injury risk (pooled hazard ratio 0.95, 0.78 to 1.16). Conclusions: Stretching before or after exercising does not confer protection from muscle soreness. Stretching before exercising does not seem to confer a practically useful reduction in the risk of injury, but the generality of this finding needs testing. Insufficient research has been done with which to determine the effects of stretching on sporting performance.},

  abstract = {A major dilemma that athletes typically face when preparing for and performing at pinnacle events such as the Olympics is that emphasis inevitably gets weighted towards desired outcomes (e.g., medals, podium, finishing order, comparative standings), particularly during the prolonged preparation periods, with the nation, media, sporting organizations, supporters and athletes themselves getting deeply drawn into this line of thinking. While this can be motivational, it also can lead to heightened anxiety and tension, and even the very best athletes struggle to handle such pressure. This article considers the dynamics involved in such thinking, and outlines practical strategies for managing the challenges it presents.

  abstract = {Muscle and bone interact via physical forces and secreted osteokines and myokines. Physical forces are generated through gravity, locomotion, exercise, and external devices. Cells sense mechanical strain via adhesion molecules and translate it into biochemical responses, modulating the basic mechanisms of cellular biology such as lineage commitment, tissue formation, and maturation. This may result in the initiation of bone formation, muscle hypertrophy, and the enhanced production of extracellular matrix constituents, adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal elements. Bone and muscle mass, resistance to strain, and the stiffness of matrix, cells, and tissues are enhanced, influencing fracture resistance and muscle power. This propagates a dynamic and continuous reciprocity of physicochemical interaction. Secreted growth and differentiation factors are important effectors of mutual interaction. The acute effects of exercise induce the secretion of exosomes with cargo molecules that are capable of mediating the endocrine effects between muscle, bone, and the organism. Long-term changes induce adaptations of the respective tissue secretome that maintain adequate homeostatic conditions. Lessons from unloading, microgravity, and disuse teach us that gratuitous tissue is removed or reorganized while immobility and inflammation trigger muscle and bone marrow fatty infiltration and propagate degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Ongoing research will certainly find new therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {According to the cross-bridge theory, the steady-state isometric force of a muscle is given by the amount of actin-myosin filament overlap. However, it has been known for more than half a century that steady-state forces depend crucially on contractile history. Here, we examine history-dependent steady-state force production in view of the cross-bridge theory, available experimental evidence, and existing explanations for this phenomenon. This is done on various structural levels, ranging from the intact muscle to the myofibrillar and isolated contractile protein level, so that advantages and limitations of the various preparations can be fully exploited and overcome. Based on experimental evidence, we conclude that steady-state force following active muscle stretching is enhanced, and this enhancement has a passive and an active component. The active component is associated with the cross-bridge kinetics, and the passive component is associated with a calcium-dependent increase in titin stiffness.

  abstract = {Background:Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is used in the prognostic evaluation of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In these patients, the ventilation feedback system is dysfunctional, and overactive peripheral chemoreceptors may be responsible for the early appearance of the respiratory compensation point (RCP) after the anaerobic threshold (AT). The mechanism of RCP appearance remains unknown and very few studies have reported the relationship between RCP and heart failure. We hypothesized that the duration between the RCP and AT (RCP-AT time) can predict the severity of cardiac disorders and prognosis in patients with HFrEF. Conclusions:RCP-AT time can better predict prognosis in patients with HFrEF than the magnitude of increase in oxygen consumption within the isocapnic buffering domain (∆V̇O2AT-RCP). It may be useful as a new prognostic indicator in these patients. Methods and Results:We enrolled 143 patients with HFrEF who underwent symptom-limited maximal CPX between 2012 and 2016. During a median follow-up of 1.4 years, cardiovascular death occurred in 45 participants (31\%). The patients who died had a significantly shorter RCP-AT time and lower hemoglobin (Hb) levels than those who survived (P{$<$}0.001 and P=0.01, respectively). Cox regression analyses revealed RCP-AT time and Hb level to be independent predictors of cardiovascular death in patients with HFrEF (P{$<$}0.001 and P=0.018, respectively).},

  abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a central player in the regulation of inflammation, haematopoiesis, immune response and host defense mechanisms. During the last decade, an accumulating amount of data suggested a pivotal role for IL-6 in metabolic processes, thus fortifying the picture of IL-6 as a multifaceted, pleiotropic cytokine. Because of its secretion by adipose tissue and contracting skeletal muscle and its broad action on central and peripheral organs, IL-6 has been termed an adipokine and a myokine. Its quantitative release from adipose tissue results in a subclinical, systemic elevation of IL-6 plasma levels with increasing body fat content, which may be implicated in the proinflammatory state leading to insulin resistance. On the other hand, IL-6 produced in the working muscle during physical activity could act as an energy sensor by activating AMP-activated kinase and enhancing glucose disposal, lipolysis and fat oxidation. In addition, both impaired IL-6 secretion and action are risk factors for weight gain. Thus, IL-6 clearly has lipolytic effects and anti-obesity potential. However, the application of IL-6 itself is at least limited by a narrow therapeutic range and its important function for a balanced inflammatory response. Further studies on the molecular basis of the metabolic effects of IL-6 could elucidate novel therapeutic strategies for custom-designed, IL-6-related substances. © 2007 The Authors.},

  abstract = {The recently described myokine, irisin is cleaved from fibronectin type III domain containing protein 5 (FNDC5) and has been proposed to be secreted upon exercise to promote the browning of beige fat cells in white adipose tissue that results in enhanced thermogenesis and increased energy expenditure. The initial studies suggested irisin as a treatment option for obesity and associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and stimulated further research. However, the results of subsequent studies investigating the regulation of irisin by different types of exercise are partly conflicting and effects were only shown in highly selective patient populations so far. Moreover, other parameters like body weight or fat free mass were shown to influence irisin adding more complexity to the mechanisms regulating this hormone. The present review will describe the discovery of irisin, its potential role in adipose tissue-mediated thermogenesis, its regulation by exercise and lastly, discuss current controversies and highlight gaps of knowledge to be filled by future studies. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of sarcopenic obesity is increasing worldwide, particularly amongst aging populations. Insulin resistance is the core mechanism of sarcopenic obesity and is also associated with variable cardiometabolic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fat accumulation in muscle tissue promotes a proinflammatory cascade and oxidative stress, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired insulin signaling, and muscle atrophy. To compound the problem, decreased muscle mass aggravates insulin resistance. In addition, the crosstalk between myokines and adipokines leads to negative feedback, which in turn aggravates sarcopenic obesity and insulin resistance. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms linking sarcopenic obesity and insulin resistance with various biological pathways. We also discuss the impact and mechanism of sarcopenic obesity and insulin resistance on cardiometabolic disease. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Primarily, this is a review of the proposed mechanisms underlying the ventilatory and lactate response to incremental exercise, which is important to the clinical interpretation of an exercise test. Since such tests are often conducted for risk stratification before major surgery, a failure to locate or justify the existence of an anaerobic threshold will have some implications for clinical practice.

  abstract = {The reliability of pulse oximetry is crucial, especially in cases of rapid changes in body oxygenation. In order to evaluate the performance of pulse oximeters during rapidly developing short periods of concurrent hypoxemia and hypercapnia, 13 healthy volunteers underwent 3 breathing phases during outdoor experiments (39 phases in total), monitored simultaneously by five different pulse oximeters. A significant incongruity in values displayed by the tested pulse oximeters was observed, even when the accuracy declared by the manufacturers were considered. In 28.2\% of breathing phases, the five used devices did not show any congruent values. The longest uninterrupted congruent period formed 74.4\% of total recorded time. Moreover, the congruent periods were rarely observed during the critical desaturation phase of the experiment. The time difference between the moments when the first and the last pulse oximeter showed the typical study endpoint values of SpO2 85\% and 75\% was 32.1 ± 23.6 s and 24.7 ± 19.3 s, respectively. These results suggest that SpO2 might not be a reliable parameter as a study endpoint, or more importantly as a safety limit in outdoor experiments. In the design of future studies, more parameters and continuous clinical assessment should be included.},

  abstract = {Irisin is a myokine derived from the cleavage of fibronectin type III domain-containing 5. Irisin regulates mitochondrial energy, glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and fat browning. Skeletal muscle and cardiomyocytes produce irisin and affect various cardiovascular functions. In the early phase of acute myocardial infarction, an increasing irisin level can reduce endothelial damage by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress. By contrast, higher levels of irisin in the later phase of myocardial infarction are associated with more cardiovascular events. During different stages of heart failure, irisin has various influences on mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, metabolic imbalance, energy expenditure, and heart failure prognosis. Irisin affects blood pressure and controls hypertension through modulating vasodilatation. Moreover, irisin can enhance vasoconstriction via the hypothalamus. Because of these dual effects of irisin on cardiovascular physiology, irisin can be a critical therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on the complex functions of irisin in myocardial ischemia, heart failure, and cardiac hypertrophy. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Summary:Forty men were tested with a computerized dynamometer for concentric and eccentric torques during arm flexion and extension at 0.52, 1.57, and 2.09 rad·s−1. Based on the summed concentric and eccentric torque scores, subjects were placed into a high strength (HS) or low strength (LS) group. The eccentric and concentric segments of the torque-velocity curves (TVCs) were generated using peak torque and constant-angle torque (CAT) at 1.57 and 2.36 rad. Angle of peak torque was also recorded. Compared to LS, HS had significantly greater estimated lean body mass (+ 10.2 kg) and approximately 25\% greater average torque output. Reliability of the peak torque scores on 2 days in 20 subjects wasr≥0.85. The difference between observed torques and the mathematically computed criterion torque scores averaged 1\% for three validation loads that ranged from 11.4 to 90.4 kg. Statistical analysis revealed that torque output in LS plateaued at low concentric velocities and was also flattened with increasing eccentric velocities. Conversely, torque ouptput for HS increased with decreasing concentric velocities and increased with increasing eccentric velocities. The method of plotting the TVCs for peak or CAT did not influence the pattern of TVC. Eccentric flexion peak torque occurred at a significantly shorter muscle length (1.88 rad) than concentric torque (2.12 rad). This difference was also present for extension; it was 1.88 rad for eccentric and 2.03 rad for concentric torque. These findings are discussed in terms of study design, neural inhibition, activation history, muscle-tendon elasticity, muscle fiber types, muscle architecture, and methodological considerations. The present results illustrate the importance of strength level to explain individual differences in TVC.},

J Strength Cond Res 23(2): 507-512, 2009-The results of previous research have demonstrated that static stretching (SS) can reduce muscular performance and that dynamic stretching (DS) can enhance muscular performance. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of SS and DS on vertical jump (VJ) performance and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the m. vastus medialis. Eleven healthy men (age 21 ± 2 years) took part in 3 conditions (no stretching [NS], SS, and DS), on separate occasions in a randomized, crossover design. During each condition, measurements of VJ height and EMG activity during the VJ were recorded. A repeated-measures analysis of variance and post hoc analysis indicated that VJ height was significantly less (4.19 ± 4.47\%) after SS than NS (p {$<$} 0.05) and significantly greater (9.44 ± 4.25\%) in DS than SS (p {$<$} 0.05). There was significantly greater EMG amplitude in the DS compared with the SS (p {$<$} 0.05). The results demonstrated that SS has a negative influence on VJ performance, whereas DS has a positive impact. Increased VJ performance after DS may be attributed to postactivation potentiation, whereas the reduction in VJ performance after SS may be attributable to neurological impairment and a possible alteration in the viscoelastic properties of the muscular tendon unit (MTU). This investigation provides some physiological basis for the inclusion of DS and exclusion of SS in preparation for activities requiring jumping performance.},

It identifies a subgroup of patients with shared pathophysiology who are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. By considering the central features of the metabolic syndrome and how they are related, we may better understand the underlying pathophysiology and disease pathogenesis. A comprehensive definition for the metabolic syndrome and its key features would facilitate research into its causes and hopefully lead to new insights into pharmacologic and lifestyle treatment approaches.},

  abstract = {Physical exercise has gradually become a focus in cancer treatment due to its pronounced role in reducing cancer risk, enhancing therapeutic efficacy, and improving prognosis. In recent decades, skeletal muscles have been considered endocrine organs, exerting their biological functions via the endocrine, autocrine, and paracrine systems by secreting various types of myokines. The amount of myokines secreted varies depending on the intensity, type, and duration of exercise. Recent studies have shown that muscle-derived myokines are highly involved the effects of exercise on cancer. Multiple myokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin M (OSM), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), and irisin, directly mediate cancer progression by influencing the proliferation, apoptosis, stemness, drug resistance, metabolic reprogramming, and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of cancer cells. In addition, IL-6, interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-15 (IL-15), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and irisin can improve obesity-induced inflammation by stimulating lipolysis of adipose tissues, promoting glucose uptake, and accelerating the browning of white fat. Furthermore, some myokines could regulate the tumor microenvironment, such as angiogenesis and the immune microenvironment. Cancer cachexia occurs in up to 80\% of cancer patients and is responsible for 22\%-30\% of patient deaths. It is characterized by systemic inflammation and decreased muscle mass. Exercise-induced myokine production is important in regulating cancer cachexia. This review summarizes the roles and underlying mechanisms of myokines, such as IL-6, myostatin, IL-15, irisin, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and musclin, in cancer cachexia. Through comprehensive analysis, we conclude that myokines are potential targets for inhibiting cancer progression and the associated cachexia. © 2022},

  abstract = {Exercise has beneficial effects in ameliorating metabolic disorders, and a combined therapeutic regimen of regular exercise and pharmaceutical treatment is often recommended. Exercise biology is complex and it involves various metabolic and molecular changes that translate into changes in substrate utilization, enzyme activation, and alternatively, improvement in exercise performance. Besides the effect of exercise on muscle metabolism, it has recently been discovered that contracting muscle can induce secretion of molecules called myokines. In the past few decades, a number of myokines have been discovered, such as interleukin-6, irisin, myostatin, interleukin-15, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, β-aminoisobutyric acid, meteorin-like, leukemia inhibitory factor, and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, through secretome analysis. The existence of myokines has enhanced our understanding of how muscles communicate with other organs such as adipose tissue, liver, bone, and brain to exert beneficial effects of exercise at the whole body level. In this review, we focus on the role of these myokines in regulating local muscle metabolism as well as systemic metabolism in an autocrine/paracrine/endocrine fashion. The therapeutic potential of myokines and the natural or synthetic compounds known to date that regulate myokines are also discussed. © 2017, The Pharmaceutical Society of Korea.},

  abstract = {An increasing body of evidence suggests that age-related immune changes and chronic inflammation contribute to cancer development. Recognizing that exercise has protective effects against cancer, promotes immune function, and beneficially modulates inflammation with ageing, this review outlines the current evidence indicating an emerging role for exercise immunology in preventing and treating cancer in older adults. A specific focus is on data suggesting that muscle- derived cytokines (myokines) mediate anti-cancer effects through promoting immunosurveillance against tumourigenesis or inhibiting cancer cell viability. Previous studies suggested that the exercise-induced release of myokines and other endocrine factors into the blood increases the capacity of blood serum to inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro. However, little is known about whether this effect is influenced by ageing. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. We therefore examined the effects of serum collected before and after exercise from healthy young and older men on the metabolic activity of androgen-responsive LNCaP and androgen-unresponsive PC3 prostate cancer cells. Exercise-conditioned serum collected from the young group did not alter cell metabolic activity, whereas post-exercise serum (compared with pre-exercise serum) from the older men inhibited the metabolic activity of LNCaP cancer cells. Serum levels of candidate cancer-inhibitory myokines oncostatin M and osteonectin increased in both age groups following exercise. Serum testosterone increased only in the younger men postexercise, potentially attenuating inhibitory effects of myokines on the LNCaP cell viability. The data from our study and the evidence in this review suggest that mobilizing serum factors and immune cells may be a key mechanism of how exercise counteracts cancer in the older population.

  abstract = {Physical inactivity is a major public health problem that contributes to the development of several pathologies such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Regular exercise mitigates the progression of these metabolic problems and contributes positively to memory and behavior. Therefore, public health agencies have incorporated exercise in the treatment of widespread disorders. The hypothalamus, specifically the ventromedial and the arcuate nuclei, responds to exercise activity and modulates energy metabolism through stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and catecholamine secretion into the circulation. In addition, physical performance enhances cognitive functions and memory, mediated mostly by an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in brain. During exercise training, skeletal muscle myofibers remodel their biochemical, morphological and physiological state. Moreover, skeletal muscle interacts with other organs by the release into the circulation of myokines, molecules that exhibit autocrine, paracrine and endocrine functions. Several studies have focused on the role of skeletal muscle and tissues in response to physical activity. However, how the hypothalamus could influence the skeletal muscle task in the context of exercise is less studied. Here, we review recent data about hypothalamus-skeletal muscle crosstalk in response to physical activity and focus on specific aspects such as the neuroendocrinological effects of exercise and the endocrine functions of skeletal muscle, to provide a perspective for future study directions. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The original concept of the NAD World was proposed in 2009, providing a comprehensive framework to investigate critical issues of biological robustness and trade-offs in mammalian aging and longevity control. Significant progress has been made over the past 7 years, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms by which biological robustness is maintained, and providing extensive support to the concept of the NAD World. Three key organs and tissues have been identified as basic elements in this control system for mammalian aging and longevity: the hypothalamus as the control center of aging, skeletal muscle as an effector, and adipose tissue as a modulator. While the hypothalamus sends a signal to skeletal muscle through the sympathetic nervous system, adipose tissue remotely regulates hypothalamic function by coordinating NAD+ biosynthesis at a systemic level. Skeletal muscle might also communicate with other organs and tissues by secreting various myokines. The mammalian NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 and the key NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme NAMPT mediate these inter-tissue communications. In this review, the function of each organ or tissue and their inter-tissue communications will be discussed in terms of understanding mammalian aging and longevity control. With such an emphasis on the system architecture, the concept is now reformulated as the NAD World 2.0, providing several important predictions. The concept of the NAD World 2.0 will provide a new foundation to understand a control system for mammalian aging and longevity and accelerate the development of an effective anti-aging intervention for humans. © The Author(s) 2016.},

  abstract = {Endocrine mechanisms have been largely associated with metabolic control and tissue cross talk in mammals. Classically, myokines comprise a class of signaling proteins released in the bloodstream by the skeletal muscle, which mediate physiological and metabolic responses in several tissues, including the brain. Recent exciting evidence suggests that myokines (e.g. cathepsin B, FNDC5/irisin, interleukin-6) act to control brain functions, including learning, memory, and mood, and may mediate the beneficial actions of physical exercise in the brain. However, the intricate mechanisms connecting peripherally released molecules to brain function are not fully understood. Accumulating findings further indicates that impaired skeletal muscle homeostasis impacts brain metabolism and physiology. Here we review recent findings that suggest that muscle-borne signals are essential for brain physiology and discuss perspectives on how these signals vary in response to exercise or muscle diseases. Understanding the complex interactions between skeletal muscle and brain may result in more effective therapeutic strategies to expand healthspan and to prevent brain disease. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Circulating concentrations of canonically pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are commonly measured when evaluating the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise. An important caveat to interpreting systemic cytokine concentrations as evidence for the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise is the observed dissociation between circulating cytokine concentrations and cytokine function at the tissue/cellular level. The dichotomization of cytokines as pro- or anti-inflammatory also overlooks the context dependence of cytokine function, which can vary depending on the physiological state being studied, the cytokine's cellular source/target, and magnitude of cytokine responses. We re-evaluate our current understanding of anti-inflammatory cytokine responses to exercise by highlighting nuances surrounding the interpretation of altered systemic cytokine concentrations as evidence for changes in inflammatory processes occurring at the tissue/cellular level. We highlight the lesser known pro-inflammatory and immunostimulatory actions of the prototypical anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, including the potentiation of interferon gamma production during endotoxaemia, CD8+ T cell activation in tumour bearing rodents and cancer patients in vivo, and CD8+ T lymphocyte and natural killer cell activation in vitro. IL-10's more well-established anti-inflammatory actions can also be blunted following exercise training and under chronic inflammatory states such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) independently of circulating IL-10 concentrations. The resistance to IL-10's anti-inflammatory action in T2D coincides with blunted STAT3 phosphorylation and can be restored with small-molecule activators of IL-10 signalling, highlighting potential therapeutic avenues for restoring IL-10 action. We posit that inferences based on altered circulating cytokine concentrations alone can miss important functional changes in cytokine action occurring at the tissue/cellular level.

  abstract = {Background: Several studies have suggested that psychosocial variables can increase the risk of becoming injured during sport participation. Objectives: The main objectives of these meta-analyses were to examine (i) the effect sizes of relationships between the psychosocial variables (suggested as injury predictors in the model of stress and athletic injury) and injury rates, and (ii) the effects of psychological interventions aimed at reducing injury occurrence (prevention). Methods: Electronic databases as well as specific sport and exercise psychology journals were searched. The literature review resulted in 48 published studies containing 161 effect sizes for injury prediction and seven effect sizes for injury prevention. Results: The results showed that stress responses (r = 0.27, 80 \% CI [0.20, 0.33]) and history of stressors (r = 0.13, 80 \% CI [0.11, 0.15]) had the strongest associations with injury rates. Also, the results from the path analysis showed that the stress response mediated the relationship between history of stressors and injury rates. For injury prevention studies, all studies included (N = 7) showed decreased injury rates in the treatment groups compared to control groups. Conclusion: The results support the model’s suggestion that psychosocial variables, as well as psychologically, based interventions, can influence injury risk among athletes.

J Strength Cond Res 22(6): 1844-1849, 2008- Stretching before performance is a common practice among athletes in hopes of increasing performance and reducing the risk of injury. However, cumulative results indicate a negative impact of static stretching and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on performance; thus, there is a need for evaluating other stretching strategies for effective warm-up. The purpose of this study was to compare the differences between two sets of ballistic stretching and two sets of a dynamic stretching routine on vertical jump performance. Twenty healthy male and female college students between the ages of 22 and 34 (24.8 ± 3 years) volunteered to participate in this study. All subjects completed three individual testing sessions on three nonconsecutive days. On each day, the subjects completed one of three treatments (no stretch, ballistic stretch, and dynamic stretch). Intraclass reliability was determined using the data obtained from each subject. A paired samples t-test revealed no significant difference in jump height, force, or power when comparing no stretch with ballistic stretch. A significant difference was found on jump power when comparing no stretch with dynamic stretch, but no significant difference was found for jump height or force. Statistics showed a very high reliability when measuring jump height, force, and power using the Kistler Quattro Jump force plate. It seems that neither dynamic stretching nor ballistic stretching will result in an increase in vertical jump height or force. However, dynamic stretching elicited gains in jump power poststretch.},

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify the long-term effect of physical activity on irisin blood levels. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles addressing the long-term effect of physical exercise on irisin blood levels. Fifty-nine articles were included in the final qualitative and quantitative syntheses. A statistically significant within-group effect of exercise on irisin blood levels was in 33 studies; out of them, the irisin level increased 23× and decreased 10×. The significant positive between-groups effect was found 11×. Furthermore, the meta-analysis indicated that physical exercise had a significant positive effect on irisin blood levels (SMD = 0.39 (95\% CI 0.27-0.52)). Nevertheless, considerably high heterogeneity was found in all the analyses. This systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that physical exercise might increase irisin blood levels; however, the results of individual studies were considerably inconsistent, which questions the methodological detection of irisin by ELISA kits. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Physiological anti-inflammatory mechanisms represent well-organized systems that have been developed by evolution to control inflammation. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction may contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic inflammatory illnesses including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The central nervous system obtains sensory inputs from the immune system through both humoral and neuronal routes. Inflammatory input activates an anti-inflammatory reaction that promptly inhibits overproduction of inflammatory cytokines. The ANS moderates gastrointestinal motility, secretion, permeability and mucosal immunity. Besides the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, in addition to its typical function of hormone secretion, controlling heart rate, gastrointestinal peristalsis, and digestion, may also be involved in the control of the immune reactions to commensal flora and alimentary constituents. It is now well recognized that cholinergic enteric neurons participate in epithelial transport and mucosal immune defense. In IBD, changes in enteric autonomic regulation may also influence neural cardiovascular control. Whether this dysfunction results from the inflammatory component of these illnesses or it is a primary cause, has not yet been satisfactorily answered. Several studies have examined the effects of exercise on the immune function. Some of them have shown that moderate and regular exercise has a significant role in the prevention and treatment of many diseases. Physical activity is inversely correlated with systemic low-level inflammation, suggesting that regular exercise may provide beneficial health effects in the patients with chronic illnesses like IBD. The protective and anti-inflammatory effects of exercise may be mediated by muscle-derived peptides called myokines. The reverse association of physical fitness with the IBD risk is consistent with a protecting role of exercise. The literature shows that very few patients receive advice from healthcare professionals regarding exercise. © 2016 Activitas Nervosa Superior Rediviva.},

  abstract = {Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased risk of stroke but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We suspect that the normal cerebrovascular response to hypoxia is disturbed in patients with OSA. Methods: Global cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and lactate concentration during hypoxia were measured in patients with OSA and matched controls. Twenty-eight patients (82.1\% males, mean age 52.3 +/- 10.0 years) with moderate-to-severe OSA assessed by partial polysomnography were examined and compared with 19 controls (73.7\% males, mean age 51.8 +/- 10.1 years). Patients and controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during 35 min of normoxia followed by 35 min inhaling hypoxic air (10\%-12\% O2). After 3 months of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, 22 patients were rescanned. Results: During hypoxia, CBF significantly increased with decreasing arterial blood oxygen concentration (4.53 mL (blood)/100 g/min per -1 mmol(O2)/L, p {$<$} 0.001) in the control group, but was unchanged (0.89 mL (blood)/100 g/min per -1 mmol(O2)/L, p = 0.289) in the patient group before CPAP treatment. The CBF response to hypoxia was significantly weaker in patients than in controls (p = 0.003). After 3 months of CPAP treatment the CBF response normalized, showing a significant increase during hypoxia (5.15 mL (blood)/100 g/min per -1 mmol(O2)/L, p {$<$} 0.001). There was no difference in CMRO2 or cerebral lactate concentration between patients and controls, and no effect of CPAP treatment. Conclusions: Patients with OSA exhibit reduced CBF in response to hypoxia. CPAP treatment normalized these patterns.},

  abstract = {What is more interesting about brown adipose tissue (BAT) is its ability to provide thermogenesis, protection against obesity by clearing triglycerides, releasing batokines, and mitigating insulin resistance. White adipose tissue (WAT) on the other hand stores excess energy and secretes some endocrine factors like leptin for regulating satiety. For the last decade there has been an increasing interest in the browning of fat keeping in view its beneficial effects on metabolic disorders and protection in the form of perivascular fat. Obesity is one such metabolic disorder that leads to significant morbidity and mortality from obesity-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and cardiovascular disease risk. Browning of white fat paves the way to restrict obesity and obesity related disorders. Although exercise has been the most common factor for fat browning; however, there are other factors that involve: (1) beta aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA); (2) gamma amino butyric acid (GABA); (3) PPARɣ agonists; (4) JAK inhibition; and (5) IRISIN. In this review, we propose two novel factors musclin and TFAM for fat browning. Musclin a myokine released from muscles during exercise activates PPARɣ which induces browning of WAT that has beneficial metabolic and cardiac effects. TFAM is a transcription factor that induces mitochondrial biogenesis. Since BAT is rich in mitochondria, higher expression of TFAM in WAT or TFAM treatment in WAT cells can induce browning of WAT. We propose that fat browning can be used as a therapeutic tool for metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. J. Cell.

  abstract = {Sarcopenia, the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength in the aged, is an important medical condition but its etiology is incompletely understood. Because autophagy promotes myofiber atrophy in the young, it was believed that autophagy inhibition would prevent sarcopenia. However, recent studies have revealed that autophagy actually maintains muscle mass and that its function declines during muscle aging. Consistently, boosting basal autophagy protects from age-related muscle dysfunction by promoting the selective degradation of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional organelles. Conversely, autophagy inhibition leads to loss of muscle strength and induces a maladaptive stress response responsible for myofiber atrophy in the aged. In addition to cell-autonomous effects, muscle autophagy and associated signaling pathways induce systemic responses in other aging tissues by modulating the expression and secretion of myokines. We propose that myokines and pharmacologic interventions that boost selective autophagy may prevent sarcopenia, delay systemic aging, and extend health span. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd}

Also, the factors engaged in irisin formation appear to suppress Aβ aggregation, which is the pathological hallmark of AD.

  abstract = {Several studies have indicated that motivational level and prior expectations are relevant aspects to increase commitment to physical activity. Moreover, these aspects are not properly described in terms of proximal (Self Determination Theory) and distal (evolutionary) explanations in the literature. This paper aims to verify if level of motivation (BREQ-2) and expectations regarding regular physical exercise (IMPRAF-54) before starting a one-year exercise program could determine likelihood of completion. Ninety-four volunteers (53 women) included a completed protocol group (CPG n=21) and drop-out group (DG n=73). The IMPRAF-54 scale was used to assess six different expectations associated with physical activity, and the BREQ-2 inventory was used to assess the level of motivation in five steps (from amotivation to intrinsic motivation). Both questionnaires were assessed before the regular exercise program. The CPG group presented higher sociability and lower pleasure scores according to IMPRAF-54 domains. A logistic regression showed that a one-point increment on sociability score increased the chance of completing the program by 10\%, and the same one-point increment on pleasure score reduced the chance of completing the protocol by 16\%. ROC curves were also calculated to establish IMPRAF-54 cutoffs for adherence (Sociability - 18.5 points – 81\% sensibility/50\% specificity) and dropout (Pleasure – 25.5 points – 86\% sensibility/20\% specificity) of the exercise protocol. Our results indicate that an expectation of social interaction was a positive factor in predicting adherence to exercise. Grounded in SDT and its innate needs (competence, autonomy, relatedness), physical exercise is not an end; it is a means to achieve autonomy and self-cohesion. The association of physical activity with social practices, like in hunter-gathering groups, can engage people to be physically active and can provide better results in adherence exercise programs for the general population.},

  abstract = {Exercise has multiple beneficial effects on health including decreasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Such effects are thought to be mediated (at least in part) by myokines, a collection of cytokines and other small proteins released from skeletal muscles. As an endocrine organ, skeletal muscle synthesizes and secretes a wide range of myokines which contribute to different functions in different organs, including the brain. One such myokine is the recently discovered protein Irisin, which is secreted into circulation from skeletal muscle during exercise from its membrane bound precursor Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5). Irisin contributes to metabolic processes such as glucose homeostasis and browning of white adipose tissue. Irisin also crosses the blood brain barrier and initiates a neuroprotective genetic program in the hippocampus that culminates with increased expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, exercise and FNDC5/Irisin have been shown to have several neuroprotective effects against injuries in ischemia and neurodegenerative disease models, including Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, Irisin has anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. In this review we present and summarize recent findings on the multiple effects of Irisin on neural function, including signaling pathways and mechanisms involved. We also discuss how exercise can positively influence brain function and mental health via the “skeletal muscle-brain axis.” While there are still many unanswered questions, we put forward the idea that Irisin is a potentially essential mediator of the skeletal muscle-brain crosstalk. © Copyright © 2021 Jodeiri Farshbaf and Alviña.},

  abstract = {Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a cytokine best known for affecting systemic energy metabolism through its anorectic action. GDF15 expression and secretion from various organs and tissues is induced in different physiological and pathophysiological states, often linked to mitochondrial stress, leading to highly variable circulating GDF15 levels. In skeletal muscle and the heart, the basal expression of GDF15 is very low compared to other organs, but GDF15 expression and secretion can be induced in various stress conditions, such as intense exercise and acute myocardial infarction, respectively. GDF15 is thus considered as a myokine and cardiokine. GFRAL, the exclusive receptor for GDF15, is expressed in hindbrain neurons and activation of the GDF15–GFRAL pathway is linked to an increased sympathetic outflow and possibly an activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. There is also evidence for peripheral, direct effects of GDF15 on adipose tissue lipolysis and possible autocrine cardiac effects. Metabolic and behavioral outcomes of GDF15 signaling can be beneficial or detrimental, likely depending on the magnitude and duration of the GDF15 signal. This is especially apparent for GDF15 production in muscle, which can be induced both by exercise and by muscle disease states such as sarcopenia and mitochondrial myopathy. © 2021 by the authors.

The present paper outlines a number of strategies based on Lazarus' cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion. Strategies are outlined that aim to change cognitions, resulting in either a more appropriate emotional response or a suppression of the expression of emotion and any maladaptive behavioral consequences. These techniques comprise selfstatement modification, imagery, socratic dialogue, corrective experiences, self-analysis, didactic approach, storytelling metaphors and poetry, reframing, cognitive paradox, and use of problem-solving skills. Furthermore, given the changes in physiological arousal accompanying certain emotions, it is also suggested that general arousal control strategies could play an important role in emotional control.

The pathophysiology of sarcopenia is related to various factors including hormonal imbalance, increased intracellular oxidative stress, reduction of food intake, advanced age, low body mass index, and low physical activity. Recently, sarcopenia has been reported to be associated with cognitive decline, and the common risk factors between sarcopenia and memory loss were observed in cohort studies. Many researchers suggested that the prevalence of sarcopenia is associated with vascular disorder, such as atherosclerosis and alteration of intracellular mechanisms caused by changes in myokine secretion. We herein review the emerging evidence on the strong link between cognitive impairment and sarcopenia, focusing on myokine secretion and vascular dysfunction, and provide an understanding of the relevant mechanisms and crucial determinants in cognitive decline caused by sarcopenia. © 2022},

  abstract = {The depletion of self-control competencies has been explained by an external shift in motivation, and recent research has emphasized that controlled types of motivation and self-control competencies are positively associated with exhaustion in youth athletes. Using the self-determination theory (SDT) and self-control theories, this study examined associations between athletes' motivation, self-control competencies, and exhaustion experiences throughout a competitive season. A total of 321 winter sport youth athletes (173 males, 98 females, and 50 unknown gender; aged 16 to 20 years, M = 17.98, SD = 0.89) participated in this 10-week longitudinal study, including three time points. Using Bayesian structural equation modeling, associations between athletes' reported level of motivation regulations, self-control, and exhaustion throughout their competitive season were examined in two mediation models. Constructs were associated in a conceptual and consistent manner. Simple mediation models showed credible indirect and direct effects of motivation on exhaustion via self-control within amotivation, and intrinsic, integrated, identified, and external regulation analyses. These credible effects were not replicated in the focused mediation model, when controlling for self-control and exhaustion autoregressive effects. However, direction of effects in both models was consistent and congruent. Findings consistently supported the interplay between motivation and exhaustion via self-control in youth athletes over an important competition period of the year. Autonomous and controlled motivation interacted with self-control and, respectively, predicted perceived exhaustion negatively and positively. Thus, autonomous self-control motives are important in preventing negative sport participation development over time. However, simple and focused mediation models showed different results, suggesting a necessity for accurate considerations of analytical methods chosen to investigate longitudinal mediation. Specifically, future studies need to carefully consider the time interval between measurement time points when investigating changes in dynamic psychological constructs, and include autoregressive longitudinal effects in order to predict change in levels of the outcome over time.},

Methods: Seven elderly elite athletes (EEA) and six physically active elderly men (PAE) completed a treadmill protocol in which blood and saliva samples were collected. Results: Blood lactate (BL) and STP increased significantly in EEA during the test (0.8 ± 0.2 to 5.1 ± 2.0 mmol/L and 42.5 ± 7.5 to 222.5 ± 63.8 mg/dL, respectively) and remained elevated at five minutes after exercise (5.0 ± 1.9 mmol/L and 147.2 ± 50.0 mg/dL, respectively). Furthermore, correlations between STP and heart rate ( r = 0.87, p {$<$} 0.001), and between BL and STP ( r = 0.96, p {$<$} 0.001), were observed in the elderly athletes. Conclusions: STP represents a potential non-invasive biomarker for determining anaerobic threshold during an incremental exercise test, and this parameter may be used as an indicator of physical exercise intensity in elderly athletes.

AMPK integrates nutritional and hormonal signals in peripheral tissues and the hypothalamus. It mediates effects of adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and possibly resistin) in regulating food intake, body weight, and glucose and lipid homeostasis. AMPK is regulated by upstream kinases of which the tumor suppressor, LKB1, is the first to be identified. Complex signaling networks suggest that AMPK may prevent insulin resistance, in part by inhibiting pathways that antagonize insulin signaling. Through signaling, metabolic, and gene expression effects, AMPK enhances insulin sensitivity and fosters a metabolic milieu that may reduce the risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {Sarcopenia, an age-associated decline in skeletal muscle mass coupled with functional deterioration, may be exacerbated by obesity leading to higher disability, frailty, morbidity and mortality rates. In the combination of sarcopenia and obesity, the state called sarcopenic obesity (SOB), some key age- and obesity-mediated factors and pathways may aggravate sarcopenia. This review will analyze the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of SOB. In obese adipose tissue (AT), adipocytes undergo hypertrophy, hyperplasia and activation resulted in accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages and other immune cells as well as dysregulated production of various adipokines that together with senescent cells and the immune cell-released cytokines and chemokines create a local pro-inflammatory status. In addition, obese AT is characterized by excessive production and disturbed capacity to store lipids, which accumulate ectopically in skeletal muscle. These intramuscular lipids and their derivatives induce mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by impaired β-oxidation capacity and increased reactive oxygen species formation providing lipotoxic environment and insulin resistance as well as enhanced secretion of some pro-inflammatory myokines capable of inducing muscle dysfunction by auto/paracrine manner. In turn, by endocrine manner, these myokines may exacerbate AT inflammation and also support chronic low grade systemic inflammation (inflammaging), overall establishing a detrimental vicious circle maintaining AT and skeletal muscle inflammation, thus triggering and supporting SOB development. Under these circumstances, we believe that AT inflammation dominates over skeletal muscle inflammation. Thus, in essence, it redirects the vector of processes from “sarcopenia~→~obesity” to “obesity~→~sarcopenia”. We therefore propose that this condition be defined as “obese sarcopenia”, to reflect the direction of the pathological pathway. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

This review describes the various types of endogenous human developmental milestones such as birth, puberty, and menopause, as well as the diverse exogenous environmental factors that influence human health, in a chronological epigenetic context. We describe the entire course of human life from periconception to death and chronologically note all of the potential internal timepoints and external factors that influence the human epigenome. Ultimately, the environment presents these various factors to the individual that influence the epigenome, and the unique epigenetic and genetic profile of each individual also modulates the specific response to these factors. During the course of human life, we are exposed to an environment that abounds with a potent and dynamic milieu capable of triggering chemical changes that activate or silence genes. There is constant interaction between the external and internal environments that is required for normal development and health maintenance as well as for influencing disease load and resistance. For example, exposure to pharmaceutical and toxic chemicals, diet, stress, exercise, and other environmental factors are capable of eliciting positive or negative epigenetic modifications with lasting effects on development, metabolism and health. These can impact the body so profoundly as to permanently alter the epigenetic profile of an individual. We also present a comprehensive new hypothesis of how these diverse environmental factors cause both direct and indirect epigenetic changes and how this knowledge can ultimately be used to improve personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {During the last two decades numerous research teams demonstrated that skeletal muscles function as an exercise-dependent endocrine organ secreting dozens of myokines. Variety of physiological and pathophysiological implications of skeletal muscle myokines secretion has been described; however, upstream signals and sensing mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. It is well documented that in skeletal muscles intensive exercise triggers dissipation of transmembrane gradient of monovalent cations caused by permanent activation of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels. Recently, we demonstrated that sustained elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio triggers expression of dozens ubiquitous genes including several canonical myokines, such as interleukin-6 and cyclooxygenase 2, in the presence of intra- and extracellular Ca2+ chelators. These data allowed us to suggest a novel [Na+]i/[K+]i-sensitive, Ca2+i-independent mechanism of excitation-transcription coupling which triggers myokine production. This pathway exists in parallel with canonical signaling mediated by Ca2+i, AMP-activated protein kinase and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). In our mini-review we briefly summarize data supporting this hypothesis as well as unresolved issues aiming to forthcoming studies. © 2015 Chongqing Medical University.},

  abstract = {Bone and muscle tissue are developed hand-in-hand during childhood and adolescence and interact through mechanical loads and biochemical pathways forming the musculoskeletal system. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is widely considered as both a bone and muscle-weakening disease, eventually leading to frailty phenotype, with detrimental effects on overall morbidity. CKD also interferes in the biomechanical communication between two tissues. Pathogenetic mechanisms including systemic inflammation, anorexia, physical inactivity, vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism, metabolic acidosis, impaired growth hormone/insulin growth factor 1 axis, insulin resistance, and activation of renin-angiotensin system are incriminated for longitudinal uncoordinated loss of bone mineral content, bone strength, muscle mass, and muscle strength, leading to mechanical impairment of the functional muscle-bone unit. At the same time, CKD may also interfere in the biochemical crosstalk between the two organs, through inhibiting or stimulating the expression of certain osteokines and myokines. This review focuses on presenting current knowledge, according to in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies, concerning the pathogenetic pathways involved in the muscle-bone axis, and suggests approaches aimed at preventing bone loss and muscle wasting in the pediatric population. Novel therapeutic targets for preserving musculoskeletal health in the context of CKD are also discussed. © 2021, IPNA.},

Seven pilots (age: 34–60) participated in a one-session test on the Boeing 737-800 simulator. Physiological data were collected while pilots wore an ambulatory multi-channel recording device. Respiratory variables, including inductance plethysmography (respiratory pattern) and pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2), were collected demonstrating change in CO2 levels proportional to changes in flight task workload. Pilots performed a set of simulation flight tasks. Pilot performance was rated for each task by a test pilot; and self-report of workload was taken using the NASA-TLX scale. Mixed model analysis revealed that respiration rate and minute ventilation are significantly associated with workload levels and evaluator scores controlling for ‘‘vanilla baseline’’ condition. Hypocapnia exclusively occurred in tasks where pilots performed more poorly. This study was designed as a preliminary investigation in order to develop a psychophysiological assessment methodology, rather than to offer conclusive findings. The results show that the respiratory system is very reactive to high workload conditions in aviation and suggest that hypocapnia may pose a flight safety risk under some circumstances.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review Skeletal muscle is gaining increased attention as an endocrine organ. Recently, novel myokines and new effects of already established myokines have been identified. The objective of this review is to give an update on the recent advances in the field. Recent findings Several hundred putative myokines have been described, some of which are induced by contraction and differentially regulated between healthy and metabolically diseased individuals. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the prototype myokine, which was identified as a muscle-derived cytokine 15 years ago. Recently, IL-6 has been linked to β-cell survival and inhibition of cancer-cell growth. Moreover, trans-signaling appears to determine whether IL-6 acts as a proinflammatory or an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Irisin has been shown to be a secreted myokine, which contribute to circulating concentrations dependent on training status. IL-15 has been established as a cytokine mediating cross-talk between skeletal muscle and skin tissue, and decorin has been characterized as a contraction-induced myokine which apparently is differentially regulated between healthy and dysglycemic individuals. Summary Skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ which, by the release of myokines, may influence metabolism in virtually all organs in the body. This knowledge may potentially open up for the possibility of designing new drugs that mimic the effects of myokine signaling. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Irisin is a myokine that is secreted from skeletal muscle during exercise and increases lipid metabolism, converting white adipose tissue to brown adipose tissue. Recent studies have shown conflicting results in relation to chronic and acute exercise and irisin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic and acute exercise training on circulating (plasma/serum) irisin level in healthy subjects. We conducted a search of Cochrane Library, PubMed, ISI, Scopus, Embase, and Pedro up to September 2021. A random effects network meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled estimate of standardized mean difference (SMD) for acute and chronic exercise effects on irisin level, using Hedge's g statistic. Of the 16 studies included, six were acute exercise studies (175 participants). The aerobic (Hedge's g=0.23; 95\% CI: -0.58, 1.03) and the anaerobic exercises (Hedge's g=0.12; 95\% CI: -0.45, 0.70) were associated with the increased level of irisin, compared to the control. In the ten chronic exercise studies (433 participants), the resistance training was superior to anaerobic and aerobic training (P score = 0.632). However, comparing acute and chronic exercise studies, acute training showed the most excellent potential as the best treatment to improve the irisin level (P score = 0.721). This network meta-analysis showed that acute aerobic exercise has a more effect on irisin levels than acute anaerobic exercise. Also, chronic resistance training has the greatest additive effect on irisin levels compared to chronic aerobic and anaerobic training. © 2022 Fatemeh Kazeminasab et al.},

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of the original ISTS protocol with an alternative shortened ISTS protocol on AT values in healthy young adults, and to assess the difference in AT values obtained during the ISTS protocols and the cycle ergometer test. Twelve healthy young adults (mean [range] age: 26.8 [22–33] years, 6 men and 6 women) performed the shortened version of the ISTS (S-ISTS), the original version of ISTS (O-ISTS), and cycle ergometer (CE) tests in a randomized order. The AT values of participants were measured during each of the three tests. No significant difference in AT values was observed among the three tests. AT obtained by individuals in the S-ISTS was significantly correlated with that obtained during the O-ISTS and CE tests with r values of 0.96 and 0.81, respectively (p {$<$} 0.05). Similar to the O-ISTS and CE test, the S-ISTS test may be used as an exercise test for the assessment of AT in a clinical setting.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-6 increases in skeletal muscle during exercise, and evidence points to Ca2+ as an initiator of IL-6 production. However, the signalling pathway whereby this occurs is unknown. One candidate for Ca2+ -mediated IL-6 induction is calcineurin, an activator of NF-AT. Here we investigated whether skeletal myocytes produce IL-6 in a Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent manner, and whether TNF-α, an inducer of IL-6, is affected by these stimuli. Human skeletal muscle cell cultures were stimulated with ionomycin time-and dose-dependently to elevate intracellular Ca2+ levels, with or without addition of cyclosporin A (CSA); a calcineurin inhibitor. mRNA was extracted from myocytes and analysed for IL-6 and TNF-α gene expression. IL-6 mRNA increased time- and dose-dependently with ionomycin stimulation, an effect that was blunted by ∼75\% in the presence of CSA. In contrast, TNF-α gene expression was decreased by ∼70\% in response to ionomycin treatment, but increased in response to addition of CSA. These data demonstrate that IL-6 and TNF-α are regulated differentially in skeletal muscle cells in response to a Ca2+ stimulus. Blocking the calcineurin pathway resulted in inhibition of the IL-6 response to ionomycin, whereas TNF-α increased by addition of CSA, further indicating a differential regulation of IL-6 and TNF-α in human skeletal myocytes.},

  abstract = {A common practice in youth rugby union is to group players based on (bi)annual age with fixed cut-off dates. The overrepresentation of players born at the start of the cut-off date and the underrepresentation of players born toward the end of the cut-off date are termed relative age effects (RAEs). The aim of this study was to examine RAEs during entry into professional and international rugby union pathways in England, as well as comparing them to their respective senior cohort: U15 Regional Academy Player (n = 1,114) vs. Senior Professional Player (n = 281) and U16-23 England Academy Player (n = 849) vs. Senior International Player (n = 48). Chi-square (chi(2)) analysis compared birth quarter (BQ) distributions against expected distributions. Odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals compared the likelihood of a BQ being selected. Findings revealed a significant overrepresentation of relatively older players compared with their relatively younger peers within both youth cohorts (P {$<$} 0.001; BQ1 = 42.5\% vs. BQ4 = 9.6\%; BQ1 = 36.5\% vs. BQ4 = 15.2\%). In comparison, there was no significant difference in the BQ distributions within both senior cohorts. Further, BQ4s were 3.86 and 3.9 times more likely to achieve senior professional and international levels than BQ1s and BQ2s, respectively. It is suggested that relatively younger players may have a greater likelihood of achieving expertise following entry into a rugby union talent pathway due to benefitting from more competitive play against relatively older counterparts during their development (e.g., reversal effects; the underdog hypothesis). Moreover, possible solutions (e.g., age and anthropometric banding; playing-up and playing-down) are discussed to encourage practitioners and policy makers to create the most appropriate learning environment for every player.},

Analyses are also reported on the relationship of those indicators of relative weight to body density in 180 young men and in 248 men aged 49–59. Judged by the criteria of correlation with height (lowest is best) and to measures of body fatness (highest is best), the ponderal index is the poorest of the relative weight indices studied. The ratio of weight to height squared, here termed the body mass index, is slightly better in these respects than the simple ratio of weight to height. The body mass index seems preferable over other indices of relative weight on these grounds as well as on the simplicity of the calculation and, in contrast to percentage of average weight, the applicability to all populations at all times.}

There are different types of body fats such as white adipose tissue (WAT), which stores surplus energy in the body, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) which utilize energy to produce heat during metabolism. BAT acts many beneficial functions in metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes and obesity. Recent studies have investigated methods for promoting the fat browning process of WAT in obesity because of various reasons such as the improvement of insulin resistance, and weight loss. Among natural polyphenolic compounds, resveratrol has been highlighted due to its anti-oxidant and anti-obesity as well as anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties. Recent studies have paid a lot of attention to that resveratrol may act as a fat browning activator, involved in the secretion of many myokines and adipokines.

Although muscles and bones are closely related throughout life, observations during development and aging and in human and animal disuse models have revealed the synchronization of tissue mass such that muscle phenotype changes precede alterations in bone mineral density and strength. This review discussed that mechanical forces, which have been the traditional research focus, are not the only mechanism by which muscle-derived signals may affect bone metabolism and emphasized the significance of skeletal muscles as an endocrine organ that secretes bone-regulatory factors. Consequently, both mechanical and biochemical aspects should be considered to fully understand muscle–bone crosstalk.

  abstract = {Exercise is recognized by clinicians in the field of clinical oncology for its potential role in reducing the risk of certain cancers and in reducing the risk of disease recurrence and progression; yet, the underlying mechanisms behind this reduction in risk are not fully understood. Studies applying post-exercise blood serum directly to various types of cancer cell lines provide insight that exercise might have a role in inhibiting cancer growth via altered soluble and cell-free blood contents. Myokines, which are cytokines produced by muscle and secreted into the bloodstream, might offer multiple benefits to cellular metabolism (such as a reduction in insulin resistance, improved glucose uptake and reduced adiposity), and blood myokine levels can be altered with exercise. Alterations in the levels of myokines such as IL-6, IL-15, IL-10, irisin, secreted protein acidic risk in cysteine (SPARC), myostatin, oncostatin M and decorin might exert a direct inhibitory effect on cancer growth via inhibiting proliferation, promoting apoptosis, inducing cell-cycle arrest and inhibiting the epithermal transition to mesenchymal cells. The association of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia with obesity can create a tumour-favourable environment; exercise-induced myokines can manipulate this environment by regulating adipose tissue and adipocytes. Exercise-induced myokines also have a critical role in increasing cytotoxicity and the infiltration of immune cells into the tumour. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.},

  abstract = {Exercise is a well-known non-pharmacological intervention to improve brain functions, including cognition, memory, and motor coordination. Contraction of skeletal muscles during exercise releases humoral factors that regulate the whole-body metabolism via interaction with other non-muscle organs. Myokines are muscle-derived effectors that regulate body metabolism by autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine action and were reportedly suggested as “exercise factors” that can improve the brain function. However, several aspects remain to be elucidated, namely the specific activities of myokines related to the whole-body metabolism or brain function, the mechanisms of regulation of other organs or cells, the sources of “exercise factors” that regulate brain function, and their mechanisms of interaction with non-muscle organs. In this paper, we present the physiological functions of myokines secreted by exercise, including regulation of the whole-body metabolism by interaction with other organs and adaptation of skeletal muscles to exercise. In addition, we discuss the functions of myokines that possibly contribute to exercise-induced improvement of brain function. Among several myokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most studied myokine that regulates adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. However, the source of circulating BDNF and its upstream effector, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and irisin and the effect size of peripheral BDNF, irisin, and IGF-1 released after exercise should be further investigated. Recently, cathepsin B has been reported to be secreted from skeletal muscles and upregulate BDNF following exercise, which was associated with improved cognitive function. We reviewed the level of evidence for the effect of myokine on the brain function. Level of evidence for the association of the change in circulating myokine following exercise and improvement of neuropsychiatric function is lower than the level of evidence for the benefit of exercise on the brain. Therefore, more clinical evidences for the association of myokine release after exercise and their effect on the brain function are required. Finally, we discuss the effect size of the action of myokines on cognitive benefits of exercise, in addition to other contributors, such as improvement of the cardiovascular system or the effect of “exercise factors” released from non-muscle organs, particularly in patients with sarcopenia. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease which may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The prevalence of sarcopenia, which is the loss of muscle mass and strength, is increasing in the aging society. Recent studies reported the relationship between NAFLD and sarcopenia. The skeletal muscle is the primary organ for glucose disposal. Loss of muscle mass can cause insulin resistance, which is an important risk factor for NAFLD. Moreover, obesity, chronic low-grade inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, physical inactivity, hepatokines, and myokines might be involved in the pathophysiologic mechanism of sarcopenia and NAFLD. Although most of the previous studies have demonstrated the positive correlation between sarcopenia and NAFLD, the difference in diagnostic methods of sarcopenia and NAFLD leads to difficulties in interpretation and application. This review discusses the concept and diagnosis of sarcopenia and NAFLD, common pathophysiology, and clinical studies linking sarcopenia to NAFLD. The presentation of the association between sarcopenia and NAFLD may provide an opportunity to prevent the deterioration of fatty liver disease.

  abstract = {Advances in medicine have paved the way for older persons to live longer, but with more years spent living with disability and dependency. Many older persons are living with comorbidities such as osteoporosis (loss of bone mass) and sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and function), two diseases that, when concurrent, form osteosarcopenia, a newly identified musculoskeletal syndrome. Osteosarcopenia impedes mobility and diminishes independence and thus quality of life. Evidence suggests the pathology of this syndrome comprises genetic polymorphisms, alterations in mechanotransduction, and localized or systemic crosstalk between growth factors and other proteins (myokines, osteokines, adipokines). As a direct result of an aging society, health outcomes such as falls and fractures will rise as the prevalence of osteosarcopenia increases. Two major risk factors for osteosarcopenia (other than age itself) are physical inactivity and poor nutrition. Addressing these modifiable risk factors can prevent, or at least delay, the onset of osteosarcopenia. Pharmaceutical treatments for osteosarcopenia are currently unavailable, although research trials are underway. This review provides an update from basic and clinical sciences on the biology, epidemiology (prevalence, risk factors and diagnosis) and treatments for osteosarcopenia, and recommends future research priorities to improve health outcomes for those living with or at risk of osteosarcopenia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review: Skeletal muscle and bone are connected anatomically and physiologically, and play a crucial role in human locomotion and metabolism. Historically, the coupling between muscle and bone has been viewed in light of mechanotransduction, which dictates that the mechanical forces applied to muscle are transmitted to the skeleton to initiate bone formation. However, these organs also communicate through the endocrine system, orchestrated by a family of cytokines namely myokines (derived from myocytes) and osteokines (derived from bone cells). A third player in this biochemical crosstalk is adipose tissue and the secretion of adipokines (derived from adipocytes). In this review, we discuss the bidirectional effects of myokines and osteokines on muscle and bone metabolism, and the impact of adipokines on both of these secretory organs. Recent Findings: Several myokines, notably, IL6, irisin, IGF-1, BDNF, myostatin, and FGF2 exert anabolic/catabolic effects on bone, while the osteokines osteocalcin and sclerostin have shown to induce muscle anabolism and catabolism, respectively. Adipokines, such as leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and TNFα (released from adipose tissue), can also modulate muscle and bone metabolism. Contrarily, exercise-mediated release of lipolytic myokines (IL6, irisin, and LIF) stimulates thermogenesis by promoting the browning of adipocytes. Summary: Myokines, osteokines, and adipokines exert autocrine/paracrine effects locally as well as through the endocrine system, to regulate muscle, bone, and fat metabolism. Reductions in physical activity and increases in energy intake, both linked with aging, leads to adipocyte hypertrophy and the recruitment of immunological cells (macrophages). In turn, this releases pro-inflammatory adipokines which induces chronic low-grade inflammation (LGI), a key player in the pathology of several diseases. However, exercise-induced stimulation of bioactive cytokines, through muscle-bone-fat crosstalk, increases muscle anabolism, bone formation, mitochondrial biogenesis, glucose utilization, and fatty acid oxidation, and attenuates chronic LGI. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

J Strength Cond Res 28(5): 1263–1271, 2014—The aim of this study was to evaluate 3 different flexibility techniques: (a) ballistic stretching (BS), (b) proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching (PNF) + BS, and (c) PNF + static stretching (SS) on vertical jump (VJ) performance and to determine the most appropriate stretching method during warm-up period before explosive force disciplines. One hundred voluntary male athletes participated in this study. All subjects performed aerobic warm-up (5-minute jog) followed by BS (5 seconds for each stretching exercise), PNF + BS (PNF performed followed by 5 seconds of BS), and PNF + SS (PNF performed followed by 30 seconds of SS) treatment protocol, respectively in the same day. Each stretching treatment was applied for 4 sets bilaterally. In all stretching treatments, lumbar extensor, gluteus maximus, and hamstring muscles were stretched with a single stretching exercise. After a 2-minute brief rest period, participants performed 3 trials of VJ test followed by one of the treatment protocols. Vertical jump performance was evaluated by countermovement jump (CMJ). Participants were divided into 3 groups according to their flexibility and prejump performances after warm-up. For each individual group and the whole group, after all treatments, differences in CMJ values were obtained (p ≤ 0.05). Ballistic stretching increased the VJ performance in the groups with low and average flexibility, poor prejumping performance, and also in the whole group (p ≤ 0.05). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching + BS affected VJ performance in the group of participants with high flexibility (p ≤ 0.05). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation + SS decreased VJ performance in groups of participants with high flexibility, moderate, and high prejumping performance and in whole group (p ≤ 0.05). Ballistic stretching method increased VJ height, therefore seems to be more suitable than PNF + SS and PNF + BS before events that rely on explosive power as a part of warm-up period.},

  abstract = {Extensive research has shown that interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional molecule that is both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory, depending on the context. Here, we combine an evolutionary perspective with physiological data to propose that IL-6’s context-dependent effects on metabolism reflect its adaptive role for short-term energy allocation. This energy-allocation role is especially salient during physical activity, when skeletal muscle releases large amounts of IL-6. We predict that during bouts of physical activity, myokine IL-6 fulfills the three main characteristics of a short-term energy allocator: it is secreted from muscle in response to an energy deficit, it liberates somatic energy through lipolysis and it enhances muscular energy uptake and transiently downregulates immune function. We then extend this model of energy allocation beyond myokine IL-6 to reinterpret the roles that IL-6 plays in chronic inflammation, as well as during COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation and multiorgan failure. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.},

  abstract = {An acute bout of exercise imposes a major challenge on whole-body metabolism and metabolic adjustments are needed in multiple tissues during recovery to reestablish metabolic homeostasis. It is currently unresolved how this regulation is orchestrated between tissues. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of skeletal muscle derived interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the coordination of the metabolic responses during recovery from acute exercise. Skeletal muscle specific IL-6 knockout (IL-6 MKO) and littermate Control mice were rested or ran on a treadmill for 2h. Plasma, skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue were obtained after 6 and 10h of recovery. Non-exercised IL-6 MKO mice had higher plasma lactate and lower plasma non-esterified fatty acids than Controls. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active form was, in skeletal muscle, higher in IL-6 MKO mice than Controls in non-exercised mice and 6h after exercise. IL-6 MKO mice had lower glucose transporter 4 protein content in inguinal adipose tissue (WAT) than Control in non-exercised mice and 10h after treadmill running. Epididymal WAT hormone sensitive lipase phosphorylation and inguinal WAT mitogen activated kinase P38 phosphorylation were higher in IL-6 MKO than Control mice 6h after exercise. These findings indicate that skeletal muscle IL-6 may play an important role in the regulation of substrate utilization in skeletal muscle, basal and exercise-induced adaptations in adipose tissue glucose uptake and lipolysis during recovery from exercise. Together this indicates that skeletal muscle IL-6 contributes to reestablishing metabolic homeostasis during recovery from exercise by regulating WAT and skeletal muscle metabolism.},

  abstract = {Evidence exists that interleukin (IL)-1β is involved in pancreatic β-cell damage, whereas TNF-α appears to be a key molecule in peripheral insulin resistance. Although increased plasma levels of IL-6 are seen in individuals with type 2 diabetes, mechanistic studies suggest that moderate acute elevations in IL-6, as provoked by exercise, exert anti-inflammatory effects by an inhibition of TNF-α and by stimulating IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra), thereby limiting IL-1β signaling. A number of medical treatments have anti-inflammatory effects. IL-1 antagonists have been tested in clinical studies and appear very promising. Also, there is a potential for anti-TNF-α strategies and salsalate has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in clinical trials. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory potential of statins, antagonists of the renin–angiotensin system, and glucose-lowering agents are discussed. While waiting for the outcome of long-term clinical pharmacological trials, it should be emphasized that physical activity represents a natural strong anti-inflammatory intervention with little or no side effects. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Subjects were tested on 2 occasions with warm-up routine randomized. There were no significant changes in vertical velocity knee angle, or the durations of the eccentric and concentric phases as a result of stretching despite good statistical power for the tests. Fifty-five percent of the subjects had lower vertical velocities (-7.5\%) after stretching, while 45 percent of the subjects had no change (10\%) or higher vertical (35\%) velocities (2.4\%) after stretching. Stretching prior to stretch-shortening cycle activities like the vertical jump results in small decreases in performance in some subjects, but the nonsignificant biomechanical changes suggest that neuromuscular inhibition may be the mechanism rather than changes in muscle stiffness.},

  abstract = {Bone is a highly dynamic tissue that is constantly adapting to micro-changes to facilitate movement. When the balance between bone building and resorption shifts more towards bone re-sorption, the result is reduced bone density and mineralization, as seen in osteoporosis or osteo-penia. Current treatment strategies aimed to improve bone homeostasis and turnover are lacking in efficacy, resulting in the search for new preventative and nutraceutical treatment options. The my-okine irisin, since its discovery in 2012, has been shown to play an important role in many tissues including muscle, adipose, and bone. Evidence indicate that irisin is associated with increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption, leading to reduced risk of osteoporosis in post-menopau-sal women. In addition, low serum irisin levels have been found in individuals with osteoporosis and osteopenia. Irisin targets key signaling proteins, promoting osteoblastogenesis and reducing osteoclastogenesis. The present review summarizes the existing evidence regarding the effects of irisin on bone homeostasis. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Sedentary life style is considered to be an independent risk factor for many disorders, including development of type 2 diabetes, obesity, immune dysfunction, asthma, and neurological or coronary heart disease. Irisin is released from myocytes during physical activity, and acts as a link between muscles and other tissues and organs. This myokine is produced as a result of proteolytic cleavage of FNDC5 protein present in the membrane of myocytes. Secretion of irisin is regulated by N-linked oligosaccharides attached to the protein molecule. The two N-glycan molecules, which constitute a significant part of the irisin glycoprotein, regulate the browning of adipocytes, which is the most important function of irisin. A receptor specific for irisin has still not been discovered. In some tissues irisin probably acts via integrins, which are widely expressed transmembrane receptors. Many studies have confirmed the multifunctional role of irisin and the beneficial effects of this molecule on body homeostasis. Irisin reduces systemic inflammation, maintains the balance between resorption and bone formation, and modulates metabolic processes and the functioning of the nervous system. It suppresses the expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in obese individuals and attenuates inflammation in adipose tissue. The impact of irisin on cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion has also been demonstrated in numerous studies, which proves its role in carcinogenesis. Owing to these pleiotropic and beneficial properties, irisin may be a potential option to prevent and treat civilization-related diseases which are, nowadays, considered to be the major health problems in Western societies. © 2019 by the authors.

  abstract = {Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in developed countries and is on the rise in developing countries. Obesity-related changes in lipid and glucose metabolism predispose to the development of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle constitutes about 40 percent of total body weight and is unique compared to other muscle types since it is one of the most important organs for insulin-dependent glucose metabolism in humans. Abnormalities in skeletal muscle lipid and glucose metabolism as well as abnormal accumulation of intramyocellular lipids could predispose for the development of type 2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle synthesizes and secretes factors with autocrine/paracrine/endocrine functions that can regulate skeletal muscle metabolism as well as affect other organs. These factors secreted by skeletal muscle are called myokines. Secretion and action of myokines is regulated by physiological conditions. Some myokines have positive effect on metabolism, improving functions of multiple organs. Yet, other myokines are released under pathological conditions and might exacerbate abnormal metabolic functions. Expression and/or secretion of a number of myokines are regulated by exercise and therefore might mediate positive effects of physical activity on whole-body metabolism. In the current review we summarized current knowledge on some of the myokines with important physiological functions in lipid and glucose metabolism. A better understanding of the effects of myokines on whole-body metabolism can aid in development of the future pharmacologic therapies for counteracting the current worldwide obesity epidemic and obesity-mediated abnormalities. © 2016 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.},

  abstract = {Exposure to high altitude activates several complex and adaptive mechanisms aiming to protect human homeostasis from extreme environmental conditions, such as hypoxia and low temperatures. Short-term exposure is followed by transient hyperglycemia, mainly triggered by the activation of the sympathetic system, whereas long-term exposure results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, mediated by improved insulin sensitivity and augmented peripheral glucose disposal. An inverse relationship between altitude, diabetes, and obesity has been well documented. This is the result of genetic and physiological adaptations principally to hypoxia that favorably affect glucose metabolism; however, the contribution of financial, dietary, and other life-style parameters may also be important. According to existing evidence, people with diabetes are capable of undertaking demanding physical challenges even at extreme altitudes. Still, a number of issues should be taken into account, including the increased physical activity leading to changes in insulin demands and resistance, the performance of measurement systems under extreme weather conditions and the potential deterioration of metabolic control during climbing expeditions. The aim of this review is to present available evidence in the field in a comprehensive way, beginning from the physiology of glucose homeostasis adaptation mechanisms to high altitudes and ending to what real life experience has taught us.},

  abstract = {Hypoxia has been known to be an omnipresent physiological threat at altitude. It has forced aircrew world over to device and look for countermeasures. Simulated hypoxia in a controlled environment of Hypobaric chamber (hypobaric hypoxia) is considered as the ‘gold standard’ for Hypoxia Awareness Training. Hypobaric chamber training has inherent hazards of decompression sickness (DCS), barotrauma and loss of consciousness (LOG). An alternative method being explored is simulated hypoxia at sea level by breathing a gas mixture containing 7.7 \% Oxygen (normobaric hypoxia). The GO2Altitude® one man hypoxicator used in this study to give desired hypoxic gas mixture, places a subject at a physiological altitude of 25000 ft and enables demonstration of symptoms of hypoxia. This framing is inherently safer than traditional training as it poses no threat of DCS as well as barotrauma and has better transfer of training for fast jet aircrew (mask- on hypoxia). This study was conducted to validate normobaric hypoxia (NH) training through GO2Altitude® hypoxicator by comparing it with hypobaric hypoxia (HH) training in hypobaric chamber. 23 participants were exposed to two regimens of hypoxia training: HH and NH at a simulated altitude of 25,000 ft. Subjective, physiological and psychomotor performance was assessed, analysed and compared. No significant differences in the frequency and severity of the 24 commonly reported symptoms, physiological response or in the psychomotor performance between the two training paradigms were found. NH is similar to HH in terms of the type and severity of subjective symptoms experienced by the participants, physiological response generated and effect on psychomotor performance and is comparable to HH. NH is an effective, useful and safe hypoxia training tool.},

  abstract = {Irisin is a novel myokine and adipokine which induces an increase in total body energy expenditure, improving insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in experimental animals. In the present study, serum irisin concentration was measured by an enzyme immunoassay in 130 women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 140 BMI-matched patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Median irisin level was significantly lower in the patients with GDM than in the NGT subjects (1703.3 [1354.8-2097.9ng/ml] versus 1873.8 [1519.8-2294.8ng/ml] , p=0.01); however, 3 months after childbirth its concentrations did not differ markedly between the two groups (1165.9 [872.1-1497.5] ng/ml versus 1139.0 [984.0-1376.7] ng/ml). In the whole group, irisin concentration correlated negatively with 2h glucose level (R=-0.14, p=0.03). In the women with NGT, irisin concentration correlated positively with ISOGTT (R=0.22, p=0.04) and the disposition index (DI120) (R=0.24, p=0.03), as well as negatively with 2h insulin level (R=-0.23, p=0.03) and HOMA-IR (R=-0.24, p=0.02). Multiple regression analysis revealed that 2h glucose and DI120 were the only variables significantly influencing serum irisin (β=0.158, p=0.03 and β=0.159, p=0.02, respectively). Our results suggest that serum irisin concentration increases markedly in pregnant women, but this increase seems to be significantly lower in patients with GDM. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

  abstract = {Physical activity has been found to aid the maintenance of health in the elderly. Exercise-induced skeletal muscle contractions lead to the production and secretion of many small proteins and proteoglycan peptides called myokines. Thus, studies on myokines are necessary for ensuring the maintenance of skeletal muscle health in the elderly. This review summarizes 13 myokines regulated by physical activity that are affected by aging and aims to understand their potential roles in metabolic diseases. We categorized myokines into two groups based on regulation by aerobic and anaerobic exercise. With aging, the secretion of apelin, β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA), bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7), decorin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), interleukin-15 (IL-15), irisin, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), sestrin, secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine (SPARC), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) decreased, while that of IL-6 and myostatin increased. Aerobic exercise upregulates apelin, BAIBA, IL-15, IL-6, irisin, SDF-1, sestrin, SPARC, and VEGF-A expression, while anaerobic exercise upregulates BMP-7, decorin, IGF-1, IL-15, IL-6, irisin, and VEGF-A expression. Myostatin is downregulated by both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. This review provides a rationale for developing exercise programs or interventions that maintain a balance between aerobic and anaerobic exercise in the elderly. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: In order to assess the prevalence of hypobaric chamber-related barotitis and evaluate a method of prevention, 335 healthy military pilots undergoing high altitude training were subject to clinical examination and tympanometry before entering the chamber. In order to minimize the risk of barotrauma, only subjects with normal preflight findings were cleared for altitude exposure. Barotitis media was diagnosed on the basis of ear pain and clinical findings according to Teed's classification. Results: Barotitis occurred in eight subjects; seven cases were monolateral and one bilateral, prevalence was 2.4\%. Conclusion: The prevalence of barotitis after hypobaric chamber training is low in our study, suggesting that a pre-chamber medical check including clinical examination and tympanometry could be effective in identifying subjects at risk.},

At present no studies have measured the interstitial concentration of IL-6 in skeletal muscle and connective tissue. The present study represents the first attempt to simultaneously measure IL-6 in plasma, skeletal muscle and peritendinous connective tissue in response to prolonged exercise. Six healthy well-trained volunteers completed a 36 km run (flat, 12 km h?1). IL-6 was measured before, 2 h post-exercise and 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h post-exercise in both the medial gastrocnemius muscle (not measured at rest due to risk of disabling the subsequent exercise, and 24 h and 72 h post-exercise) and the peritendinous tissue around the Achilles tendon using microdialysis catheters with a high molecular mass cut-off value (3000 kDa). The plasma concentration of IL-6 was measured simultaneously, and in addition every hour during the exercise, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The plasma concentration of IL-6 was found to increase throughout the exercise, reaching peak values immediately after completion of the run (50-fold increase). Using the microdialysis technique, the interstitial concentration of IL-6 was found to increase dramatically from 0 ± 0 pg ml?1 to 3618 ± 1239 pg ml?1 in the peritendinous tissue in the hours following the exercise. The pattern of changes was similar in plasma and peritendinous tissue, although approximately 100-fold higher in the latter. For comparison the interstitial muscle concentration was found to be 465 ± 176 pg ml?1 when measured 2 h post-exercise and 223 ± 113 pg ml?1 and 198 ± 96 pg ml?1 48 h and 96 h post-exercise, respectively. The present study demonstrates that the connective tissue around the human Achilles tendon produces significant amounts of IL-6 in response to prolonged physical activity, which might contribute to the exercise-induced increase in IL-6 found in plasma.},

  abstract = {The dissociation of bone formation and resorption is an important physiological process during spaceflight. It also occurs during local skeletal unloading or immobilization, such as in people with neuromuscular disorders or those who are on bed rest. Under these conditions, the physiological systems of the human body are perturbed down to the cellular level. Through the absence of mechanical stimuli, the musculoskeletal system and, predominantly, the postural skeletal muscles are largely affected. Despite in-flight exercise countermeasures, muscle wasting and bone loss occur, which are associated with spaceflight duration. Nevertheless, countermeasures can be effective, especially by preventing muscle wasting to rescue both postural and dynamic as well as muscle performance. Thus far, it is largely unknown how changes in bone microarchitecture evolve over the long term in the absence of a gravity vector and whether bone loss incurred in space or following the return to the Earth fully recovers or partly persists. In this review, we highlight the different mechanisms and factors that regulate the humoral crosstalk between the muscle and the bone. Further we focus on the interplay between currently known myokines and osteokines and their mutual regulation. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Physical activity reduces cardiometabolic risk, while physical inactivity increases chronic diseases risk. This led to the idea that exercise-induced muscle contraction contributes to metabolic regulation and health. It is now well established that skeletal muscle, through the release of endocrine factors, i.e., so-called myokines, crosstalk with metabolic organs such as adipose tissue, liver and pancreas. Recent advances suggested that a number of myokines are able to modulate adipose tissue metabolism and thermogenic activity, liver endogenous glucose production and β-cell insulin secretion. This novel paradigm offers a compelling hypothesis and molecular basis to explain the link between physical inactivity and chronic diseases. Herein, we review major findings and recent advances linking exercise, myokines secretion and inter-organ crosstalk. Identifying the molecular mediators linking physical activity to metabolic health could open the path toward novel therapeutic targets in metabolic diseases. © Copyright © 2020 Laurens, Bergouignan and Moro.},

  abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints. Organokines can produce beneficial or harmful effects in this condition. Among RA patients, organokines have been associated with increased inflammation and cartilage degradation due to augmented cytokines and metalloproteinases production, respectively. This study aimed to perform a review to investigate the role of adipokines, osteokines, myokines, and hepatokines on RA progression. PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane were searched, and 18 studies were selected, comprising more than 17,000 RA patients. Changes in the pattern of organokines secretion were identified, and these could directly or indirectly contribute to aggravating RA, promoting articular alterations, and predicting the disease activity. In addition, organokines have been implicated in higher radiographic damage, immune dysregulation, and angiogenesis. These can also act as RA potent regulators of cells proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, controlling osteoclasts, chondrocytes, and fibroblasts as well as immune cells chemotaxis to RA sites. Although much is already known, much more is still unknown, principally about the roles of organokines in the occurrence of RA extra-articular manifestations. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent worldwide public burden that increasingly compromises overall health as the disease progresses. Two of the most negatively affected tissues are bone and skeletal muscle, with CKD negatively impacting their structure, function and activity, impairing the quality of life of these patients and contributing to morbidity and mortality. Whereas skeletal health in this population has conventionally been associated with bone and mineral disorders, sarcopenia has been observed to impact skeletal muscle health in CKD. Indeed, bone and muscle tissues are linked anatomically and physiologically, and together regulate functional and metabolic mechanisms. With the initial crosstalk between the skeleton and muscle proposed to explain bone formation through muscle contraction, it is now understood that this communication occurs through the interaction of myokines and osteokines, with the skeletal muscle secretome playing a pivotal role in the regulation of bone activity. Regular exercise has been reported to be beneficial to overall health. Also, the positive regulatory effect that exercise has been proposed to have on bone and muscle anatomical, functional, and metabolic activity has led to the proposal of regular physical exercise as a therapeutic strategy for muscle and bone-related disorders. The detection of bone- and muscle-derived cytokine secretion following physical exercise has strengthened the idea of a cross communication between these organs. Hence, this review presents an overview of the impact of CKD in bone and skeletal muscle, and narrates how these tissues intrinsically communicate with each other, with focus on the potential effect of exercise in the modulation of this intercommunication. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Physical exercise has beneficial effects on metabolic diseases, and a combined therapeutic regimen of regular exercise and pharmaceutical treatment is often recommended for their clinical management. However, the mechanisms by which exercise produces these beneficial effects are not fully understood. Myokines, a group of skeletal muscle (SkM) derived peptides may play an important part in this process. Myokines are produced, expressed and released by muscle fibers under contraction and exert both local and pleiotropic effects. Myokines such as IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra released during physical exercise mediate its health benefits. Just as exercise seems to promote the myokine response, physical inactivity seems to impair it, and could be a mechanism to explain the association between sedentary behavior and many chronic diseases. Myokines help configure the immune-metabolic factor interface and the health promoting effects of physical exercise through the release of humoral factors capable of interacting with other tissues, mainly adipose tissue (AT). AT itself secretes proinflammatory cytokines (adipokines) as a result of physical inactivity and it is well recognized that AT inflammation can lead to the development of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and atherosclerosis. On the other hand, the browning phenotype of AT has been suggested to be one of the mechanisms through which physical exercise improves body composition in overweight/obese individuals. Although, many cytokines are involved in the crosstalk between SkM and AT, in respect of these effects, it is IL-6, IL-15, irisin, and myostatin which seem to have the decisive role in this "conversation" between AT and SkM. This review article proposes to bring together the latest "state of the art" knowledge regarding Myokines and muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk. Furthermore, it is intended to particularly focus on the immune-metabolic changes from AT directly mediated by myokines. © 2018 Leal, Lopes and Batista.},

  abstract = {becoming the most common chronic liver pathology both in adults and children. NAFLD manifestation ranges from a simple liver steatosis to steatohepatitis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis - NASH), which may progress to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Due to the coexistence of visceral obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, NAFLD is considered to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. In recent years, in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and also NAFLD, more and more attention has been paid to the so-called organokines, proteins with both paracrine or/and endocrine activities. These include most known adipokines (mainly produced by adipose tissue), myokines (mainly produced by skeletal muscles) and hepatokines exclusively or predominantly produced by the liver. It was shown that the liver may affect the lipids and glucose metabolism by hepatokines released into the blood and NAFLD seems to be associated with altered hepatokines production. Fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21), selenoprotein P, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), angiopoietin-related growth factor (also known as angiopoietin-related protein 6) and leukocyte derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) are considered as the most important hepatokines. In this review, we provide an overview of the main hepatokines and we summarize the association of liver-derived proteins with the development and progression of NAFLD.},

  abstract = {Molecular oxygen (O2) sustains intracellular bioenergetics and is consumed by numerous biochemical reactions, making it essential for most species on Earth. Accordingly, decreased oxygen concentration (hypoxia) is a major stressor that generally subverts life of aerobic species and is a prominent feature of pathological states encountered in bacterial infection, inflammation, wounds, cardiovascular defects and cancer. Therefore, key adaptive mechanisms to cope with hypoxia have evolved in mammals. Systemically, these adaptations include increased ventilation, cardiac output, blood vessel growth and circulating red blood cell numbers. On a cellular level, ATP-consuming reactions are suppressed, and metabolism is altered until oxygen homeostasis is restored. A critical question is how mammalian cells sense oxygen levels to coordinate diverse biological outputs during hypoxia. The best-studied mechanism of response to hypoxia involves hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), which are stabilized by low oxygen availability and control the expression of a multitude of genes, including those involved in cell survival, angiogenesis, glycolysis and invasion/metastasis. Importantly, changes in oxygen can also be sensed via other stress pathways as well as changes in metabolite levels and the generation of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria. Collectively, this leads to cellular adaptations of protein synthesis, energy metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, lipid and carbon metabolism as well as nutrient acquisition. These mechanisms are integral inputs into fine-tuning the responses to hypoxic stress.},

  abstract = {The low rates of regular exercise and overall physical activity (PA) in the general population represent a significant public health challenge. Previous research suggests that, for many people, exercise leads to a negative affective response and, in turn, reduced likelihood of future exercise. The purpose of this paper is to examine this exercise-affect-adherence relationship from an evolutionary perspective. Specifically, we argue that low rates of physical exercise in the general population are a function of the evolved human tendency to avoid unnecessary physical exertion. This innate tendency evolved because it allowed our evolutionary ancestors to conserve energy for physical activities that had immediate adaptive utility such as pursuing prey, escaping predators, and engaging in social and reproductive behaviors. The commonly observed negative affective response to exercise is an evolved proximate psychological mechanism through which humans avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. The fact that the human tendencies toward negative affective response to and avoidance of unnecessary physical activities are innate does not mean that they are unchangeable. Indeed, it is only because of human-engineered changes in our environmental conditions (i.e., it is no longer necessary for us to work for our food) that our predisposition to avoid unnecessary physical exertion has become a liability. Thus, it is well within our capabilities to reengineer our environments to once again make PA necessary or, at least, to serve an immediate functional purpose. We propose a two-pronged approach to PA promotion based on this evolutionary functional perspective: first, to promote exercise and other physical activities that are perceived to have an immediate purpose, and second, to instill greater perceived purpose for a wider range of physical activities. We posit that these strategies are more likely to result in more positive (or less negative) affective responses to exercise, better adherence to exercise programs, and higher rates of overall PA.

  abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are disorders character-ized by progressive degeneration of the nervous system. Currently, there is no disease-modifying treatments for most NDs. Meanwhile, numerous studies conducted on human and animal models over the past decades have showed that exercises had beneficial effects on NDs. Inter-tissue com-munication by myokine, a peptide produced and secreted by skeletal muscles during exercise, is thought to be an important underlying mechanism for the advantages. Here, we reviewed studies about the effects of myokines regulated by exercise on NDs and their mechanisms. Myokines could exert beneficial effects on NDs through a variety of regulatory mechanisms, including cell survival, neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, proteostasis, oxidative stress, and protein modification. Studies on exercise-induced myokines are expected to provide a novel strategy for treating NDs, for which there are no adequate treatments nowadays. To date, only a few myokines have been investigated for their effects on NDs and studies on mechanisms involved in them are in their infancy. Therefore, future studies are needed to discover more myokines and test their effects on NDs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

While direct relationships between muscle activity, adipose tissue and breast tissue have been highlighted in recent years, few studies have focused on the effects of obesity and physical activity during the development of breast cancer, particularly at the level of cell signaling. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue modulate the cell metabolism by secreting myokines and adipokines. These secreted cytokines belong to a crosstalk network via cell signaling pathway modulation. The understanding of the tissue crosstalk is fundamental to the management of physical activity in the care of obese breast cancer patients. Therefore, this review focuses on the effects of obesity and physical activity during the development of breast cancer, particularly at the level of cell signaling. We focuse on the main mediators, secreted by both adipose and muscle tissue, which are implicated in breast cancer development. We presente the variation of these mediators in the physiopathological context of their secreted tissue. Then, we open the discussion on the crosstalk of these tissues in breast carcinogenesis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Hypoxia, defined as a reduced oxygen availability, can be observed in many tissues in response to various physiological and pathological conditions. As a hallmark of the altitude environment, ambient hypoxia results from a drop in the oxygen pressure in the atmosphere with elevation. A hypoxic stress can also occur at the cellular level when the oxygen supply through the local microcirculation cannot match the cells’ metabolic needs. This has been suggested in contracting skeletal myofibers during physical exercise. Regardless of its origin, ambient or exercise-induced, muscle hypoxia triggers complex angio-adaptive responses in the skeletal muscle tissue. These can result in the expression of a plethora of angio-adaptive molecules, ultimately leading to the growth, stabilization, or regression of muscle capillaries. This remarkable plasticity of the capillary network is referred to as angio-adaptation. It can alter the capillary-to-myofiber interface, which represent an important determinant of skeletal muscle function. These angio-adaptive molecules can also be released in the circulation as myokines to act on distant tissues. This review addresses the respective and combined potency of ambient hypoxia and exercise to generate a cellular hypoxic stress in skeletal muscle. The major skeletal muscle angio-adaptive responses to hypoxia so far described in this context will be discussed, including existing controversies in the field. Finally, this review will highlight the molecular complexity of the skeletal muscle angio-adaptive response to hypoxia and identify current gaps of knowledges in this field of exercise and environmental physiology. © Copyright © 2021 Lemieux and Birot.},

  abstract = {Exercise, in the form of endurance or resistance training, leads to specific molecular and cellular adaptions not only in skeletal muscles, but also in many other organs such as the brain, liver, fat or bone. In addition to direct effects of exercise on these organs, the production and release of a plethora of different signaling molecules from skeletal muscle are a centerpiece of systemic plasticity. Most studies have so far focused on the regulation and function of such myokines in acute exercise bouts. In contrast, the secretome of long-term training adaptation remains less well understood, and the contribution of non-myokine factors, including metabolites, enzymes, microRNAs or mitochondrial DNA transported in extracellular vesicles or by other means, is underappreciated. In this review, we therefore provide an overview on the current knowledge of endurance and resistance exercise-induced factors of the skeletal muscle secretome that mediate muscular and systemic adaptations to long-term training. Targeting these factors and leveraging their functions could not only have broad implications for athletic performance, but also for the prevention and therapy in diseased and elderly populations. © Copyright © 2021 Leuchtmann, Adak, Dilbaz and Handschin.},

Ten male triathletes (age: 22.1 +/- 1.1 years; VO2max: 59.4 +/- 1.4 ml/kg/min) participated in this double-blind/crossover/counter-balanced design study. Participants completed 3 TT trials: 1) normoxic placebo (NPLA; FiO2 = 20.9\%), 2) hypoxic placebo (HPLA; FiO2 = 16.3\%), and 3) hypoxic CHO (HCHO; 6\% CHO provided as 2 ml/kg/15 min; FiO2 = 16.3\%). During the TT, physiological responses (SpO2, HR, RPE, and blood glucose/lactate), cognitive performance, and cerebral haemodynamics were measured. Hypoxia reduced TT performance by \textasciitilde 3.5-4\% (p {$<$} 0.05), but CHO did not affect TT performance under hypoxia. For the cognitive task, CHO slightly preserved exercise-induced cognitive reaction speed but did not affect response accuracy during hypoxic exercise. However, CHO did not preserve the decreased Hb-Diff (cerebral blood flow, CBF) and increased HHb in the prefrontal lobe (p {$<$} 0.05) during hypoxic exercise, and CHO failed to preserve hypoxia-suppressed prefrontal CBF and tissue oxygen saturation. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that CHO is effective in sustaining reaction speed for a cognitive task but not promoting TT performance during hypoxic exercise, which would be important for strategy-/decision-making when athletes compete at moderate high-altitude.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review This article updates on the concept that muscle-derived cytokines (myokines) play important roles in muscle health and disease. Recent findings Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is released from normal skeletal muscle in response to exercise, mediating both antiinflammatory responses and metabolic adaptations, actions contradictory to the prevailing view that IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is inducing and propagating disease. The anti-inflammatory effects of IL-6 result from its trans-membrane signalling capability, via membrane-bound receptors, whereas its proinflammatory effects result instead from signalling via the soluble IL-6 receptor and gp130. IL-15 is elevated following exercise, promoting muscle fibre hypertrophy in some circumstances, while inducing fibre apoptosis in others. This functional divergence appears because of variations in expression of IL-15 receptor isoforms. Decorin, a recently described myokine, is also elevated following exercise in normal muscle, and promotes muscle fibre hypertrophy by competitively binding to, and thus inhibiting, myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle protein synthesis. Exercise-induced myostatin downregulation thus promotes muscle fibre growth, prompting recent trials of a biological myostatin inhibitor in inclusion body myositis. Summary Myokines appear to exert diverse beneficial effects, though their mechanistic roles in myositis and other myopathologies remain poorly understood. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

  abstract = {Aging causes degenerative changes such as epigenetic changes and mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. Exercise can upregulate muscle mitochondrial homeostasis and enhance antioxidant capacity and represents an effective treatment to prevent muscle aging. Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications, and microRNA expression are involved in the regulation of exercise-induced adaptive changes in muscle mitochondria. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in signaling molecules in exercise-induced muscle mitochondrial health benefits, and strong evidence emphasizes that exercise-induced ROS can regulate gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. The majority of mitochondrial proteins are imported into mitochondria from the cytosol, so mitochondrial homeostasis is regulated by nuclear epigenetic mechanisms. Exercise can reverse aging-induced changes in myokine expression by modulating epigenetic mechanisms. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of exercisegenerated ROS in the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. In addition, the potential epigenetic mechanisms involved in exercise-induced myokine expression are reviewed. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {The heart is an organ with extremely high energy expenditure, and cardiac performance is consistent with its metabolic level. Under pathological situations, the heart adjusts its metabolic pattern through mitochondrial regulation and substrate selection to maintain energy homeostasis. Heart failure is associated with impaired cardiac energy production, transduction or utilization. Reduced exercise tolerance, skeletal muscle dystrophy and even cardiac cachexia are commonly found in patients with advanced heart failure. Irisin is a newly identified myokine and is mainly secreted by skeletal muscles after exercise. Irisin regulates metabolism and plays essential roles in the development of metabolic diseases. The heart is another abundant source of irisin synthesis and secretion other than skeletal muscle. However, the functions of irisin in the heart have not been completely elucidated. This review introduces the current understanding of the physiological role of irisin, alteration of irisin levels in heart failure, possible mechanisms of irisin in metabolic remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy, and perspectives of irisin serving as a novel target in the management of heart failure. © 2020 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

  abstract = {High-intensity exercise/training, especially interval exercise/training, has gained popularity in recent years. Hypoxic training was introduced to elite athletes half a century ago and has recently been adopted by the general public. In the current review, we have summarised the molecular adaptive responses of skeletal muscle to high-intensity exercise/training, focusing on mitochondrial biogenesis, angiogenesis, and muscle fibre composition. The literature suggests that (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) PGC-1ff, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1-ff) might be the main mediators of skeletal muscle adaptations to high-intensity exercises in hypoxia. Exercise is known to be anti-inflammatory, while the effects of hypoxia on inflammatory signalling are more complex. The anti-inflammatory effects of a single session of exercise might result from the release of anti-inflammatory myokines and other cytokines, as well as the downregulation of Toll-like receptor signalling, while training-induced anti-inflammatory effects may be due to reductions in abdominal and visceral fat (which are main sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines). Hypoxia can lead to inflammation, and inflammation can result in tissue hypoxia. However, the hypoxic factor HIF1-ff is essential for preventing excessive inflammation. Disease-induced hypoxia is related to an upregulation of inflammatory signalling, but the effects of exercise-induced hypoxia on inflammation are less conclusive. The effects of high-intensity exercise under hypoxia on skeletal muscle molecular adaptations and inflammatory signalling have not been fully explored and are worth investigating in future studies. Understanding these effects will lead to a more comprehensive scientific basis for maximising the benefits of high-intensity exercise. © 2020 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue are the two largest organs in the body. Skeletal muscle is an effector organ, and adipose tissue is an organ that stores energy; in addition, they are endocrine organs that secrete cytokines, namely myokines and adipokines, respectively. Myokines consist of myostatin, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-15, irisin, fibroblast growth factor 21, and myonectin; adipokines include leptin, adiponectin, resistin, chemerin, and visfatin. Furthermore, certain cytokines, such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, are released by both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and exhibit a bioactive effect; thus, they are called adipo-myokines. Recently, novel myokines or adipokines were identified through the secretomic technique, which has expanded our knowledge on the previously unknown functions of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and provide a new avenue of investigation for obesity treatment or animal production.

  abstract = {Insulin resistance is recognized as one major feature of metabolic syndrome, and frequently emerges as a difficult problem encountered during long-term pharmacological treatment of diabetes. Insulin resistance often causes organs or tissues, such as skeletal muscle, adipose, and liver, to become less responsive or resistant to insulin. Exercise can promote the physiological function of those organs and tissues and benefits insulin action via increasing insulin receptor sensitivity, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial function. This is done by decreasing adipose tissue deposition, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress. However, understanding the mechanism that regulates the interaction between exercise and insulin function becomes a challenging task. As a novel myokine, irisin is activated by exercise, released from the muscle, and affects multi-organ functions. Recent evidence indicates that it can promote glucose uptake, improve mitochondrial function, alleviate obesity, and decrease inflammation, as a result leading to the improvement of insulin action. We here will review the current evidence concerning the signaling pathways by which irisin regulates the effect of exercise on the up-regulation of insulin action in humans and animals. © 2022 by the authors.

Extensive efforts have been devoted to developing approaches capable of providing measures of brain oxygen metabolism not only under normal physiological conditions but, more importantly, in various pathophysiological conditions such as cerebral ischemia. In particular, quantitative measures of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen using positron emission tomography (PET) have been shown to be capable of discerning brain tissue viability during ischemic insults. However, the complex logistics associated with oxygen-15 PET have substantially hampered its wide clinical applicability. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based approaches have provided quantitative measures of cerebral oxygen metabolism similar to that obtained using PET. Given the wide availability, MRI-based approaches may have broader clinical impacts, particularly in cerebral ischemia, when time is a critical factor in deciding treatment selection. In this article, we review the pathophysiological basis of altered cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism in cerebral ischemia, how quantitative measures of cerebral metabolism were obtained using the Kety-Schmidt approach, the physical concepts of non-invasive oxygen metabolism imaging approaches, and, finally, clinical applications of the discussed imaging approaches.},

Studies have reported that hypoxia can induce a decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the brains of both humans and animals. Hypoxia and the associated cerebral hemodynamic changes can contribute to cognitive performance deficits that may endanger flight safety and increase the risk of accidents. AIM: In this study, we aimed to identify region-specific alterations in CBF in male pilots after exposure to hypoxia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling sequences in 35 healthy male pilots (mean age: 30.6 +/- 4.82 years) under simulated hypoxic conditions with a 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The generated CBF maps were measured and averaged in several regions of interest. RESULTS: Hypoxia decreased CBF in various brain regions, including the right temporal and bilateral occipital lobes, the anterior and posterior lobes of the cerebellum, the culmen and declive, and the inferior semilunar lobule of the cerebellum. CONCLUSION: These changes may impact the functional activity of the brains of pilots experiencing hypoxia in flight, but the related mechanisms require further investigation.},

Our results show that autophagy was suppressed in the livers of mice with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Transcript levels of some key autophagy genes were also suppressed in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Conversely, autophagy activity was increased in the livers of mice with streptozotocin-induced insulin deficiency. Levels of vps34, atg12, and gabarapl1 transcripts were elevated in the livers of mice with insulin deficiency. To study the mechanism, autophagy was induced by nutrient deprivation or glucagon in cultured hepatocytes in the presence or absence of insulin. Autophagy activity and transcript levels of vps34, atg12, and gabarapl1 genes were reduced by insulin. The effect of insulin was largely prevented by overexpression of the constitutive nuclear form of FoxO1. Importantly, autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy) in cultured cells was suppressed by insulin in the presence of insulin resistance. Together, our results show that autophagy activity and expression of some key autophagy genes were suppressed in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Insulin suppression of autophagy involves FoxO1-mediated transcription of key autophagy genes.}

  abstract = {Irisin is a PGC-1α-dependent myokine that causes increased energy expenditure by driving the development of white adipose tissue into brown fat-like tissue. Exercise can improve irisin levels and lead to its release into the blood. In ischemic stroke, neurons are always sensitive to energy supply; after a series of pathophysiological processes, reactive oxygen species that are detrimental to cell survival via mitochondrial dysfunction are generated in large quantities. As a protein associated with exercise, irisin can alleviate brain injury in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. It is thought that irisin can upregulate the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which protects nerve cells from injury during ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the release of irisin into the blood via exercise influences the mitochondrial dynamics crucial to maintaining the normal function of nerve cells. Consequently, we intended to summarize the known effects of irisin during ischemic stroke. © Copyright © 2020 Liu, Zhu, Guo, Chen and Meng.},

  abstract = {Physical inactivity has been recognized, by the World Health Organization as the fourth cause of death (5.5~\% worldwide). On the contrary, physical activity (PA) has been associated with improved quality of life and decreased risk of several diseases (i.e., stroke, hypertension, myocardial infarction, obesity, malignancies). Bone turnover is profoundly affected from PA both directly (load degree is the key determinant for BMD) and indirectly through the activation of several endocrine axes. Several molecules, secreted by muscle (myokines) and adipose tissues (adipokines) in response to exercise, are involved in the fine regulation of bone metabolism in response to the energy availability. Furthermore, bone regulates energy metabolism by communicating its energetic needs thanks to osteocalcin which acts on pancreatic β-cells and adipocytes. The beneficial effects of exercise on bone metabolism depends on the intermittent exposure to myokines (i.e., irisin, IL-6, LIF, IGF-I) which, instead, act as inflammatory/pro-resorptive mediators when chronically elevated; on the other hand, the reduction in the circulating levels of adipokines (i.e., leptin, visfatin, adiponectin, resistin) sustains these effects as well as improves the whole-body metabolic status. The aim of this review is to highlight the newest findings about the exercise-dependent regulation of these molecules and their role in the fine regulation of bone metabolism. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Bone tissue can be seen as a physiological hub of several stimuli of different origin (e.g., dietary, endocrine, nervous, immune, skeletal muscle traction, biomechanical load). Their integration, at the bone level, results in: (i) changes in mineral and protein composition and microarchitecture and, consequently, in shape and strength; (ii) modulation of calcium and phosphorous release into the bloodstream, (iii) expression and release of hormones and mediators able to communicate the current bone status to the rest of the body. Different stimuli are able to act on either one or, as usual, more levels. Physical activity is the key stimulus for bone metabolism acting in two ways: through the biomechanical load which resolves into a direct stimulation of the segment(s) involved and through an indirect load mediated by muscle traction onto the bone, which is the main physiological stimulus for bone formation, and the endocrine stimulation which causes homeostatic adaptation. The third way, in which physical activity is able to modify bone functions, passes through the immune system. It is known that immune function is modulated by physical activity; however, two recent insights have shed new light on this modulation. The first relies on the discovery of inflammasomes, receptors/sensors of the innate immunity that regulate caspase-1 activation and are, hence, the tissue triggers of inflammation in response to infections and/or stressors. The second relies on the ability of certain tissues, and particularly skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, to synthesize and secrete mediators (namely, myokines and adipokines) able to affect, profoundly, the immune function. Physical activity is known to act on both these mechanisms and, hence, its effects on bone are also mediated by the immune system activation. Indeed, that immune system and bone are tightly connected and inflammation is pivotal in determining the bone metabolic status is well-known. The aim of this narrative review is to give a complete view of the exercise-dependent immune system-mediated effects on bone metabolism and function. Copyright © 2019 Lombardi, Ziemann and Banfi.},

  abstract = {Exercise perturbs homeostasis, alters the levels of circulating mediators and hormones, and increases the demand by skeletal muscles and other vital organs for energy substrates. Exercise also affects bone and mineral metabolism, particularly calcium and phosphate, both of which are essential for muscle contraction, neuromuscular signaling, biosynthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and other energy substrates. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is involved in the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Understanding the effects of exercise on PTH secretion is fundamental for appreciating how the body adapts to exercise. Altered PTH metabolism underlies hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism, the complications of which affect the organs involved in calcium and phosphorous metabolism (bone and kidney) and other body systems as well. Exercise affects PTH expression and secretion by altering the circulating levels of calcium and phosphate. In turn, PTH responds directly to exercise and exercise-induced myokines. Here, we review the main concepts of the regulation of PTH expression and secretion under physiological conditions, in acute and chronic exercise, and in relation to PTH-related disorders. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract = {Nowadays, whole-body cryotherapy is a medical physical treatment widely used in sports medicine. Recovery from injuries (e.g., trauma, overuse) and after-season recovery are the main purposes for application. However, the most recent studies confirmed the anti-inflammatory, anti-analgesic, and anti-oxidant effects of this therapy by highlighting the underlying physiological responses. In addition to its therapeutic effects, whole-body cryotherapy has been demonstrated to be a preventive strategy against the deleterious effects of exercise-induced inflammation and soreness. Novel findings have stressed the importance of fat mass on cooling effectiveness and of the starting fitness level on the final result. Exposure to the cryotherapy somehow mimics exercise, since it affects myokines expression in an exercise-like fashion, thus opening another possible window on the therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. From a biochemical point of view, whole-body cryotherapy not always induces appreciable modifications, but the final clinical output (in terms of pain, soreness, stress, and post-exercise recovery) is very often improved compared to either the starting condition or the untreated matched group. Also, the number and the frequency of sessions that should be applied in order to obtain the best therapeutic results have been deeply investigated in the last years. In this article, we reviewed the most recent literature, from 2010 until present, in order to give the most updated insight into this therapeutic strategy, whose rapidly increasing use is not always based on scientific assumptions and safety standards. © 2017 Lombardi, Ziemann and Banfi.},

  abstract = {Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic alterations mostly related to visceral adiposity, which in turn promotes glucose intolerance and a chronic systemic inflammatory state, characterized by immune cell infiltration. Such immune system activation increases the risk of severe disease subsequent to viral infections. Strong correlations between elevated body mass index (BMI), type-2-diabetes and increased risk of hospitalization after pandemic influenza H1N1 infection have been described. Similarly, a correlation between elevated blood glucose level and SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and mortality has been described, indicating MetS as an important predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Adipose secretome, including two of the most abundant and well-studied adipokines, leptin and interleukin-6, is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and obesity-related low-grade inflammation. Similarly, skeletal muscle hormones—called myokines—released in response to physical exercise affect both metabolic homeostasis and immune system function. Of note, several circulating hormones originate from both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and display different functions, depending on the metabolic context.

We identified and summarized longitudinal studies that, supporting the association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with either type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome, suggest that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease precedes the development of both conditions. Online Medical databases were searched, relevant articles were identified, their references were further assessed and tabulated data were checked. Although several cross-sectional studies linked nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to either diabetes and other components of the metabolic syndrome, we focused on 28 longitudinal studies which provided evidence for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as a risk factor for the future development of diabetes. Moreover, additional 19 longitudinal reported that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease precedes and is a risk factor for the future development of the metabolic syndrome. Finally, molecular and genetic studies are discussed supporting the view that aetiology of steatosis and lipid intra-hepatocytic compartmentation are a major determinant of whether fatty liver is/is not associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Data support the novel paradigm of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as a strong determinant for the development of the metabolic syndrome, which has potentially relevant clinical implications for diagnosing, preventing and treating metabolic syndrome.},

Low skeletal muscle mass is associated with poor clinical outcomes such as post-operative complications, chemotherapy toxicity and mortality in older cancer patients.

In this review, we summarize proposed pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between low skeletal muscle mass and poor clinical outcomes in older cancer patients including a) systemic inflammation; b) insulin-dependent glucose handling; c) mitochondrial function; d) protein status and; e) pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs. The mechanisms of altered myokine balance negatively affecting the innate and adaptive immune system, and altered pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs leading to a relative overdosage of anticancer drugs are best-substantiated. The effects of glucose intolerance and circulating mitochondrial DNA as a consequence of low skeletal muscle mass are topics of interest for future research. Restoring myokine balance through physical exercise, exercise mimetics, neuro-muscular activation and adapting anticancer drug dosing on skeletal muscle mass could be targeted approaches to improve clinical outcomes in older cancer patients with low skeletal muscle mass. © 2020 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

The path analytic model was used to test mediating pathways. First, the results revealed that commitment to the team was positively related to characteristics of resilience and negatively to vulnerability under pressure. Second, bootstrap mediation analysis showed that athletes' perceptions of the task and social intra-group conflict mediated the association between their perception of commitment to the team and team resilience factors. Findings provide initial evidence for a link between commitment to the team and team resilience in national teams and also suggest that intra-group conflict can improve the association between commitment to the team and team resilience.

Despite the overwhelming data linking obesity to cardiovascular disease, several studies have shown a paradoxical association between obesity and prognosis among those with coronary disease and heart failure, which may be due to limitations of the way we currently define obesity. There is abundant data suggesting that measuring central obesity or total body fat content might be more appropriate than using the body mass index alone. The management of obesity is challenging and studies using lifestyle modification alone or with pharmacologic agents generally have limited success and high levels of weight regain.

  abstract = {Sarcopenia is characterized by loss of muscle and reduction in muscle strength that contributes to higher mortality rate and increased incidence of fall and hospitalization in the elderly. Mitochondria dysfunction and age-associated inflammation in muscle are two of the main attributors to sarcopenia progression. Recent clinical trials on sarcopenia therapies such as physical exercise, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical interventions have revealed that exercise is the only effective strategy shown to alleviate sarcopenia. Unlike nutraceutical and pharmaceutical interventions that showed controversial results in sarcopenia alleviation, exercise was found to restore mitochondria homeostasis and dampen inflammatory responses via a complex exchange of myokines and osteokines signalling between muscle and bone. However, as exercise have limited benefit to immobile patients, the use of stem cells and their secretome are being suggested to be novel therapeutics that can be catered to a larger patient population owing to their mitochondria restoration effects and immune modulatory abilities. As such, we reviewed the potential pros and cons associated with various stem cell types/secretome in sarcopenia treatment and the regulatory and production barriers that need to be overcome to translate such novel therapeutic agents into bedside application. Translational potential: This review summarizes the causes underlying sarcopenia from the perspective of mitochondria dysfunction and age-associated inflammation, and the progress of clinical trials for the treatment of sarcopenia.

We aimed to verify whether asymmetries provided by isokinetic assessments, jump tests, and tensiomyography (TMG) are associated with each other, and whether their respective functional indices are related to jumping ability. TMG parameters, unilateral and bilateral squat-jump (SJ) and countermovement-jump (CMJ) performances, and peak torque in knee-extension and flexion with angular velocities of 60o/s and 300o/s for twenty-four soccer players were retained for analyses. Asymmetry was detected by examining the percentage difference between dominant and non-dominant legs. The median-split technique was used to identify the best and worst performers in SJ and CMJ tests. Results revealed that the asymmetries detected in the three different methods were not interrelated. Curiously, better performances in SJ and CMJ tests were associated with higher asymmetry levels. Furthermore, only the knee-extension peak torque at both angular velocities was correlated moderately to largely (r=0.48-0.66) with jump performance. Despite their recognized ability to predict the risk of injury, the absence of interrelationships between TMG, isokinetic tests, and unilateral jumps precludes their single use as a unique functional screening diagnostic. Finally, and very importantly, lower-limb asymmetry is not necessarily related to impaired vertical jump performance in soccer players.},

  abstract = {Pulse oximeter performance is degraded by motion artifacts and low perfusion. Manufacturers developed algorithms to improve instrument performance during these challenges. There have been no independent comparisons of these devices.We evaluated the performance of four pulse oximeters (Masimo Radical-7, USA; Nihon Kohden OxyPal Neo, Japan; Nellcor N-600, USA; and Philips Intellivue MP5, USA) in 10 healthy adult volunteers. Three motions were evaluated: tapping, pseudorandom, and volunteer-generated rubbing, adjusted to produce photoplethsmogram disturbance similar to arterial pulsation amplitude. During motion, inspired gases were adjusted to achieve stable target plateaus of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) at 75\%, 88\%, and 100\%. Pulse oximeter readings were compared with simultaneous arterial blood samples to calculate bias (oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry [SpO2] − SaO2), mean, SD, 95\% limits of agreement, and root mean square error. Receiver operating characteristic curves were determined to detect mild (SaO2 \&lt; 90\%) and severe (SaO2 \&lt; 80\%) hypoxemia.Pulse oximeter readings corresponding to 190 blood samples were analyzed. All oximeters detected hypoxia but motion and low perfusion degraded performance. Three of four oximeters (Masimo, Nellcor, and Philips) had root mean square error greater than 3\% for SaO2 70 to 100\% during any motion, compared to a root mean square error of 1.8\% for the stationary control. A low perfusion index increased error.All oximeters detected hypoxemia during motion and low-perfusion conditions, but motion impaired performance at all ranges, with less accuracy at lower SaO2. Lower perfusion degraded performance in all but the Nihon Kohden instrument. We conclude that different types of pulse oximeters can be similarly effective in preserving sensitivity to clinically relevant hypoxia.},

  abstract = {Significance: Exercise-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways through genomic and nongenomic mechanisms that are responsible for the beneficial effects of exercise in muscle. Beyond the positive effect of exercise on skeletal muscle cells, other tissues such as white and brown adipose, liver, central nervous system, endothelial, heart, and endocrine organ tissues are also responsive to exercise. Recent Advances: Crosstalk between different cells is essential to achieve homeostasis and to promote the benefits of exercise through paracrine or endocrine signaling. This crosstalk can be mediated by different effectors that include the secretion of metabolites of muscle contraction, myokines, and exosomes. During the past 20 years, it has been demonstrated that contracting muscle cells produce and secrete different classes of myokines, which functionally link muscle with nearly all other cell types. Critical Issues: The redox signaling behind this exercise-induced crosstalk is now being decoded. Many of these widespread beneficial effects of exercise require not only a complex ROS-dependent intramuscular signaling cascade but simultaneously, an integrated network with many remote tissues. Future Directions: Strong evidence suggests that the powerful beneficial effect of regular physical activity for preventing (or treating) a large range of disorders might also rely on ROS-mediated signaling. Within a contracting muscle, ROS signaling may control exosomes and myokines secretion. In remote tissues, exercise generates regular and synchronized ROS waves, creating a transient pro-oxidative environment in many cells. These new concepts integrate exercise, ROS-mediated signaling, and the widespread health benefits of exercise. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.},

However, the response of rcSO(2) and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) to hypoxia in preschool children has not been previously assessed. A total of 36 preschool patients who had undergone a tonsillectomy [age, 4-6 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II] were screened and prospectively enrolled in the present study. Hemodynamics, including rcSO(2), SpO(2), non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram and capnography, were continuously monitored throughout the study. Following pre-oxygenation, pressure-controlled ventilation with 100\% oxygen was administered through a mask with a flow rate of 6 l/min, under total intravenous anesthesia, and the end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure was maintained between 30 and 40 mmHg. Tracheal intubation was then performed and ventilation was paused until SpO(2) decreased to 90\% or rcSO(2) decreased by {$>$}10\% of the baseline level. The duration from pausing of mechanical ventilation to the start of the rcSO(2) decline was shorter than that of SpO(2) (80.2±23.6 sec vs. 124.4±20.5 sec; P{$<$}0.001). Subsequent to the recovery of ventilation, the duration from the starting point to the increasing point of the baseline of rcSO(2) was longer than that of SpO(2) (84.8±24.3 sec vs. 15.2±6.8 sec; P{$<$}0.001). From the point where mechanical ventilation was paused to when rcSO(2)/SpO(2) began to decrease, the rcSO(2) and SpO(2) values decreased and a significant correlation of them was observed (Pearson's correlation coefficient=0.317; P=0.027). From the time-point where mechanical ventilation was recovered to the time-point where rcSO(2) or SpO(2) began to increase, rcSO(2) and SpO(2) values decreased and a significant correlation of them was observed (Spearman's correlation coefficient=0.489; P=0.006).

The circulating irisin level is reported to be associated with exercise, obesity, diet, diseases, and exposure to different pharmacological agents. Several studies have attempted to characterize the role of irisin in PCOS and other reproductive diseases, but contradictory results have been reported. Our previous study showed that irisin may serve further functions in folliculogenesis and fertility. In this review, we present the current knowledge on the physiology of irisin and its role in gonadal axis. Firstly, we describe irisin circulating levels and speculate on the potential mechanisms involved in irisin secretion and regulation. Then, we focus on the irisin levels in PCOS, and explore the relationships between, BMI, insulin resistance, and hyperandrogenism. Finally, we present the results from animal interventional studies and in vitro experiments to investigate the relationship between irisin and gonadal axis, indicating its novel effects on reproduction and fertility. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Human aging is characterized by both physical and physiological frailty. A key feature of frailty, sarcopenia is the age-associated decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and endurance that characterize even the healthy elderly. Increases in adiposity, particularly in visceral adipose tissue, are almost universal in aging individuals and can contribute to sarcopenia and insulin resistance by increasing levels of inflammatory cytokines known collectively as adipokines. Aging also is associated with declines in adaptive and innate immunity, known as immune senescence, which are risk factors for cancer and all-cause mortality. The cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) is highly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue and declines in aging rodent models. IL-15 inhibits fat deposition and insulin resistance, is anabolic for skeletal muscle in certain situations, and is required for the development and survival of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes. We review the effect that adipokines and myokines have on NK cells, with special emphasis on IL-15. We posit that increased adipokine and decreased IL-15 levels during aging constitute a common mechanism for sarcopenia, obesity, and immune senescence. © Lutz and Quinn.},

  abstract = {In 2002, a transmembrane protein - now known as FNDC5 - was discovered and shown to be expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. It was virtually ignored for 10 years, until a study in 2012 proposed that, in response to exercise, the ectodomain of skeletal muscle FNDC5 was cleaved, traveled to white adipose tissue, and induced browning. The wasted energy of this browning raised the possibility that this myokine, named irisin, might mediate some beneficial effects of exercise. Since then, more than 1000 papers have been published exploring the roles of irisin. A major interest has been on adipose tissue and metabolism, following up the major proposal from 2012. Many studies correlating plasma irisin levels with physiological conditions have been questioned for using flawed assays for irisin concentration. However, experiments altering irisin levels by injecting recombinant irisin or by gene knockout are more promising. Recent discoveries have suggested potential roles of irisin in bone remodeling and in the brain, with effects potentially related to Alzheimer's disease. We discuss some discrepancies between research groups and the mechanisms that are yet to be determined. Some important questions raised in the initial discovery of irisin, such as the role of the mutant start codon of human FNDC5 and the mechanism of ectodomain cleavage, remain to be answered. Apart from these specific questions, a promising new tool has been developed - mice with a global or tissue-specific knockout of FNDC5. In this review, we critically examine the current knowledge and delineate potential solutions to resolve existing ambiguities. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

  abstract = {Long-term cigarette smoking (LTCS) represents an important risk factor for cardiac infarction and stroke and the central risk factor for the development of a bronchial carcinoma, smoking-associated interstitial lung fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The pathophysiologic development of these diseases is suggested to be promoted by chronic and progressive inflammation. Cigarette smoking induces repetitive inflammatory insults followed by a chronic and progressive activation of the immune system. In the pulmonary system of cigarette smokers, oxidative stress, cellular damage, and a chronic activation of pattern recognition receptors are described which are followed by the translocation of the NF-kB, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteases, and damage-associated molecular patterns. In parallel, smoke pollutants cross directly through the alveolus–capillary interface and spread through the systemic bloodstream targeting different organs. Consequently, LTCS induces a systemic low-grade inflammation and increased oxidative stress in the vascular system. In blood, these processes promote an increased coagulation and endothelial dysfunction. In muscle tissue, inflammatory processes activate catabolic signaling pathways followed by muscle wasting and sarcopenia. In brain, several characteristics of neuroinflammation were described. Regular exercise training has been shown to be an effective nonpharmacological treatment strategy in smoke-induced pulmonary diseases. It is well established that exercise training exerts immune-regulating effects by activating anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. In this regard, the release of myokines from contracting skeletal muscle, the elevations of cortisol and adrenalin, the reduced expression of Toll-like receptors, and the increased mobilization of immune-regulating leukocyte subtypes might be of vital importance. Exercise training also increases the local and systemic antioxidative capacity and several compensatory mechanisms in tissues such as an increased anabolic signaling in muscle or an increased compliance of the vascular system. Accordingly, regular exercise training seems to protect long-term smokers against some important negative local and systemic consequences of smoking. Data suggest that it seems to be important to start exercise training as early as possible. © 2018 Madani et al.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) influences both inflammatory response and anti-inflammatory process-es. This cytokine can be released by exercising skeletal muscle, which characterizes it as a myokine. Unlike what is observed in inflammation, IL-6 produced by skeletal muscle is not preceded by the release of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, but it seems to be dependent on the lactate produced during exercise, thus causing different effects from those seen in inflammatory state. After binding to its receptor, myokine IL-6 activates the PI3K-Akt pathway. One consequence of this upregulation is the potentiation of insulin signaling, which enhances insulin sensitivity. IL-6 increases GLUT-4 vesicle mobilization to the muscle cell periphery, increasing the glucose transport into the cell, and also glycogen synthesis. Muscle glycogen provides energy for ATP resynthesis, and regulates Ca2+ release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, influencing muscle contraction, and, hence, muscle function by multiple pathways. Another implication for the upregulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway is the activation of mTORC1, which regulates mRNA translational efficiency by regulating translation machinery, and translational capacity by inducing ribosomal biogenesis. Thus, IL-6 may contribute to skeletal muscle hypertrophy and function by increasing contractile protein synthesis. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a motivational model of the coach-athlete relationship that describes how coaches may influence athletes' motivation. In line with cognitive evaluation theory (Deci and Ryan, 1980, 1985) and the hierarchical model of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (Vallerand, 1997, 2000), a motivational sequence is proposed where coaches' personal orientation towards coaching, the context within which they operate, and their perceptions of their athletes' behaviour and motivation influence coaches' behaviours. Also, coaches' behaviours in the form of autonomy-supportive behaviours, provision of structure and involvement have a beneficial impact on athletes' needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, which, in turn, nurture athletes' intrinsic motivation and self-determined types of extrinsic motivation. Here, we first review coaches' autonomy-supportive behaviours. We then describe the psychological processes through which coaching behaviours have a positive influence on athletes' intrinsic and self-determined extrinsic motivation. Finally, we identify social and personality processes that determine coaching behaviours.},

  abstract = {Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) represent a heterogeneous group of autoimmune diseases whose treatment is often a challenge. Many patients, even after immunosuppressive therapy, do not respond to treatment, so new alternatives have been sought for this. Therefore, other signaling pathways that could contribute to the pathogenesis of myositis have been investigated, such as the expression of myokines in skeletal muscle in response to the inflammatory process. In this review, we will refer to these muscle cytokines that are overexpressed or downregulated in skeletal muscle in patients with various forms of IIM, thus being able to contribute to the maintenance of the autoimmune process. Some muscle cytokines, through their antagonistic action, may be a helpful contributor to the disease modulation, and thus, they could represent personalized treatment targets. Here, we consider the main myokines involved in the pathogenesis of myositis, expressing our view on the possibility of using them as potential therapeutic targets: interleukins IL-6, IL-15, and IL-18; chemokines CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CCL20; myostatin; follistatin; decorin; osteonectin; and insulin-like 6. An interesting topic regarding the complex connection between myokines and noninflammatory pathways implied in IIM has also been briefly described, because it is an important scientific approach to the pathogenesis of IIM and can be a therapeutic alternative to be considered, especially for the patients who do not respond to immunosuppressive treatment. © 2020 Vlad Mageriu et al.},

  abstract = {Irisin is a novel myokine and adipokine that has gained much attention recently due to its mechanisms of action. Irisin is secreted following proteolytic cleavage of its precursor fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5). Following its release, irisin exerts its major action by increasing the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1), which facilitates the conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) into beige adipose tissue. Irisin is distributed in various body tissues and several actions have been attributed to its presence in those tissues. It has been suggested that it plays a role in metabolic diseases, ageing, inflammation and neurogenesis. However, the circulating levels of irisin are modulated by several factors such as diet, obesity, exercise, pharmacological agents and different pathological conditions. In this review, we have discussed the mechanisms by which irisin influences the functions of different body systems and how external factors in turn affect the circulating level of irisin. In conclusion, modification of circulating irisin level may help in the management of a variety of endocrine and metabolic disorders. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Exercise not only produces beneficial effects on muscle itself via various molecular pathways, but also mediates the interaction between muscles and other organs in an autocrine/paracrine manner through myokines, which plays a positive role in maintaining overall health. Irisin, an exercise-derived myokine, has been found involved in the regulation of some cardiovascular diseases. However, the relationship between irisin and cardiovascular health is not fully elucidated and there are some divergences on the regulation of irisin by exercise. In this review, we present the current knowledge on the origin and physiology of irisin, describe the regulation of irisin by acute and chronic exercises, and discuss the divergences of the related research results. Importantly, we discuss the role of irisin as a biomarker in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and describe its treatment and molecular mechanism in some cardiovascular diseases. It is expected that irisin will be used as a therapeutic agent to combat cardiovascular diseases or other disorders caused by inactivity in the near future. © Copyright © 2021 Ma, Ding, Deng, Liu, Xiong and Yang.},

Using Braun and Clarke's procedures for thematic analysis, the authors interpreted data from semistructured interviews deductively in relation to five strategic themes in which psychological skills are applied for performance enhancement. Deductive results demonstrated MAs used goal setting, imagery, arousal regulation, concentration, and self-confidence to enhance performance and obtain competitive advantages. The authors also analyzed data inductively to reveal themes related to experiential and lifestyle factors. Inductive results showed that MAs "placed priorities on sport," which involved cognitively justifying the priority and framing sport as an outlet and as the embodiment of the authentic self. Social strategies associated with continued sport pursuit included cultivation of supportive social environments, social contracts/negotiations, social signaling, and social accountability. Strategies "to fit sport in" included integrating/twinning, scheduling, and managing commitment. Managing age-related concerns involved mindfulness and compensation strategies. Results show how MAs uniquely apply sport psychology to enhance their performance and to support sport adherence.

  abstract = {Classical approaches to engineer skeletal muscle tissue based on current regenerative and surgical procedures still do not meet the desired outcome for patient applications. Besides the evident need to create functional skeletal muscle tissue for the repair of volumetric muscle defects, there is also growing demand for platforms to study muscle-related diseases, such as muscular dystrophies or sarcopenia. Currently, numerous studies exist that have employed a variety of biomaterials, cell types and strategies for maturation of skeletal muscle tissue in 2D and 3D environments. However, researchers are just at the beginning of understanding the impact of different culture settings and their biochemical (growth factors and chemical changes) and biophysical cues (mechanical properties) on myogenesis. With this review we intend to emphasize the need for new in vitro skeletal muscle (disease) models to better recapitulate important structural and functional aspects of muscle development. We highlight the importance of choosing appropriate system components, e.g., cell and biomaterial type, structural and mechanical matrix properties or culture format, and how understanding their interplay will enable researchers to create optimized platforms to investigate myogenesis in healthy and diseased tissue. Thus, we aim to deliver guidelines for experimental designs to allow estimation of the potential influence of the selected skeletal muscle tissue engineering setup on the myogenic outcome prior to their implementation. Moreover, we offer a workflow to facilitate identifying and selecting different analytical tools to demonstrate the successful creation of functional skeletal muscle tissue. Ultimately, a refinement of existing strategies will lead to further progression in understanding important aspects of muscle diseases, muscle aging and muscle regeneration to improve quality of life of patients and enable the establishment of new treatment options. © 2018 Maleiner, Tomasch, Heher, Spadiut, Rünzler and Fuchs.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, clear evidence has emerged that the cellular components of skeletal muscle are important sites for the release of proteins and peptides called “myokines”, suggesting that skeletal muscle plays the role of a secretory organ. After their secretion by muscles, these factors serve many biological functions, including the exertion of complex autocrine, paracrine and/or endocrine effects. In sum, myokines affect complex multi-organ processes, such as skeletal muscle trophism, metabolism, angiogenesis and immunological response to different physiological (phys-ical activity, aging, etc.) or pathological states (cachexia, dysmetabolic conditions, chronic inflam-mation, etc.). The aim of this review is to describe in detail a number of myokines that are, to varying degrees, involved in skeletal muscle aging processes and belong to the group of proteins present in the functional environment surrounding the muscle cell known as the “Niche”. The particular my-okines described are those that, acting both from within the cell and in an autocrine manner, have a defined relationship with the modulation of oxidative stress in muscle cells (mature or stem) involved in the regulatory (metabolic or regenerative) processes of muscle aging. Myostatin, IGF-1, NGF, S100 and irisin are examples of specific myokines that have peculiar features in their mechanisms of action. In particular, the potential role of one of the most recently characterized myokines— irisin, directly linked to an active lifestyle—in reducing if not reversing senescence-induced oxida-tive damage is discussed in terms of its possible application as an agent able to counteract the deleterious effects of muscle aging. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {The fundamental cause of obesity is widely assumed to be an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended (i.e., the energy balance theory). However, this century-old obesity paradigm is fallacious. According to known laws of physics, the actual etiology of obesity is chronic positive mass balance, not positive energy balance. Furthermore, the relevant physical law in body mass regulation is the Law of Conservation of Mass, not the Law of Conservation of Energy. It is important to understand that energy balance and mass balance are separate balances in the human body. Since calories simply represent the heat released on food oxidation, they have no impact on body mass. Body mass can only change as a result of net mass flow; thus, the only food property that can augment body mass is its nutrient mass, not its energy content. The recently proposed mass balance model describes the temporal evolution of body weight and body composition under a wide variety of feeding experiments, and it seems to provide a highly accurate description of the very best experimental human feeding data. By shifting to a mass balance paradigm of obesity, a deeper understanding of this condition may follow in the near future. The purpose of this living review is to present the core issues of the upcoming paradigm shift and some practical applications related to the subject.},

  abstract = {Cachexia is an extremely serious syndrome which occurs in most patients with different cancers, and it is characterized by systemic inflammation, a negative protein and energy balance, and involuntary loss of body mass. This syndrome has a dramatic impact on the patient’s quality of life, and it is also associated with a low response to chemotherapy leading to a decrease in survival. Despite this, cachexia is still underestimated and often untreated. New research is needed in this area to understand this complex phenomenon and ultimately find treatment methods and therapeutic targets. The skeletal muscle can act as an endocrine organ. Signaling between muscles and other systems is done through myokines, cytokines, and proteins produced and released by myocytes. In this review, we would like to draw attention to some of the most important myokines that could have potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets: myostatin, irisin, myonectin, decorin, fibroblast growth factor 21, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-15.

  abstract = {Although their physiology and functions are very different, bones, skeletal and smooth muscles, as well as the heart have the same embryonic origin. Skeletal muscles and bones interact with each other to enable breathing, kinesis, and the maintenance of posture. Often, muscle and bone tissues degenerate synchronously under various conditions such as cancers, space travel, aging, prolonged bed rest, and neuromuscular diseases. In addition, bone tissue, skeletal and smooth muscles, and the heart share common signaling pathways. The RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway, which is essential for bone homeostasis, is also implicated in various physiological processes such as sarcopenia, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular diseases. Several studies have reported bone-skeletal muscle crosstalk through the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway. This review will summarize the current evidence indicating that the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway is involved in muscle function. First, we will briefly discuss the role this pathway plays in bone homeostasis. Then, we will present results from various sources indicating that it plays a physiopathological role in skeletal, smooth muscle, and cardiac functions. Understanding how the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway interferes in several physiological disorders may lead to new therapeutic approaches aimed at protecting bones and other tissues with a single treatment.

The role of irisin in multiorgan protection has been gradually revealed, and this muscle-derived circulating factor is regarded as an essential bridge linking exercise and organ health.

  abstract = {Significance: The prevalence and incidence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) tend to increase along with the enhanced average of the world life expectancy. NDDs are a major cause of morbidity and disability, affecting the health care, social and economic systems with a significant impact. Critical Issues and Recent Advances: Despite the worldwide burden of NDDs and the ongoing research efforts to increase the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in NDD pathophysiologies, pharmacological therapies have been presenting merely narrow benefits. On the contrary, absent of detrimental side effects but growing merits, regular physical exercise (PE) has been considered a prone pleiotropic nonpharmacological alternative able to modulate brain structure and function, thereby stimulating a healthier and "fitness"neurological phenotype. Future Directions: This review summarizes the state of the art of some peripheral and central-related mechanisms that underlie the impact of PE on brain plasticity as well as its relevance for the prevention and/or treatment of NDDs. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to better clarify the molecular signaling pathways associated with muscle contractions-related myokines release and its plausible positive effects in the brain. In addition, particular focus of research should address the role of PE in the modulation of mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress in the context of NDDs. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

  abstract = {Incretins are gut hormones that potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) after meals. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is the most investigated incretin hormone, synthesized mainly by L cells in the lower gut tract. GLP-1 promotes β-cell function and survival and exerts beneficial effects in different organs and tissues. Irisin, a myokine released in response to a high-fat diet and exercise, enhances GSIS. Similar to GLP-1, irisin augments insulin biosynthesis and promotes accrual of β-cell functional mass. In addition, irisin and GLP-1 share comparable pleiotropic effects and activate similar intracellular pathways. The insulinotropic and extra-pancreatic effects of GLP-1 are reduced in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients but preserved at pharmacological doses. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are therefore among the most widely used antidiabetes drugs, also considered for their cardiovascular benefits and ability to promote weight loss. Irisin levels are lower in T2D patients, and in diabetic and/or obese animal models irisin administration improves glycemic control and promotes weight loss. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that both GLP-1 and irisin are also synthesized within the pancreatic islets, in α-and β-cells, respectively. This review aims to describe the similarities between GLP-1 and irisin and to propose a new potential axis–involving the gut, muscle, and endocrine pancreas that controls energy homeostasis. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Recent scientific efforts have focused on the detrimental effects that obesity has on the metabolic function of skeletal muscles and whether exercise can improve this dysfunction. In this regard, adiponectin, with important metabolic functions (e.g. insulin-sensitizer and anti-inflammatory), has been recently described as a myokine that acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Earlier studies reported that muscle adiponectin could be induced by pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. lipopolysaccharide), cytokines, and high-fat diets, providing a protective mechanism of this tissue against metabolic insults. However, when metabolic insults such as high-fat diets are sustained this protective response becomes dysregulated, making the skeletal muscle susceptible to metabolic impairments. Recent studies have suggested that exercise could prevent or even reverse this process. Considering that most scientific knowledge on adiponectin dysregulation in obesity is from the study of adipose tissue, the present review summarizes and discusses the literature available to date regarding the effects of obesity on skeletal muscle adiponectin induction, along with the potential effects of different exercise prescriptions on this response in an obesity context. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

Physical exercise can modulate kynurenine pathway metabolism in skeletal muscle and thus change the concentrations of select compounds in peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of how exercise alters tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in muscle and its subsequent local and distal effects. We propose that the effects of kynurenine pathway metabolites on skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, immune system, and the brain suggest that some of these compounds could qualify as exercise-induced myokines. Indeed, some of the more recently discovered biological activities for kynurenines include many of the best-known benefits of exercise: improved energy homeostasis, promotion of an anti-inflammatory environment, and neuroprotection. Finally, by considering the tissue expression of the different membrane and cytosolic receptors for kynurenines, we discuss known and potential biological activities for these tryptophan metabolites. © 2020 the American Physiological Society},

  abstract = {Background: The 20th and 21st centuries are marked by an increase in life expectancy one hand and on the other hand by the increase of so called civilization diseases. Their share one common trait: the energy metabolism imbalance, with low energy expenditure and high energy uptake. Our age can be viewed as the age of inactivity and wealth. yiadimir Methods: The aim of the present review is to highlight the influence of habitual physical activity on energy metabolism and balance. Results: Energy balance is the difference between energy intake and energy expenditure, where energy expenditure further divides into resting metabolic rate, thermic effect of feeding and energy used by physical activity. In general population, resting metabolic rate remains constant and proportional to muscle body mass. Muscle mass increases with exercise, especially resistance exercise, concomitantly with increasing energy expenditure. The effect of exercise on appetite is very strong, proportional to exercise intensity. An acute bout of aerobic exercise suppresses appetite by decreasing ghrelin plasma levels, and increasing gut hormones. Different subgroups of patients respond differently to the same exercise or habitual activity and have thus distinct effects on energy balance. Different myokines plasma levels after exercise could explain these different reactions although most of their effect is still unclear. Conclusion: Physical activity plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of many disorders, like obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, psychiatric and neurologic disorders. It is evident, that physical activity has an effect not only on energy balance but also has a direct effect on other body organ via its own molecules - myokines. The pharmacological effect of myokines gives hope that one day we could have a “myokine drug” that could be used in patients who are unable to exercise. Until then we should use our “muscle-pharmacy” and try to convince also our patients to use theirs. Physical activity makes a huge impact on human health. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

The purpose of the present review was to determine which psychological factors affect the success of rehabilitation and return to sport following the most frequent musculotendinous thigh injuries (hamstrings, hip adductors, knee extensors), and to present the main psychological screening tools and interventions that can aid the athlete's rehabilitation and return to sport. A systematic review of the literature did not reveal any relevant results related to those injuries; therefore, the search was expanded to whole lower limb injuries, which showed that several different psychological factors could have a significant impact on an athlete's rehabilitation and decision to return to sport. It can be presumed that these factors can similarly affect the post-injury process for thigh injuries, which should be considered when planning the rehabilitation programme. Systematically implementing psychological screening and psychological interventions (if needed) into the already established rehabilitation protocols would be reasonable for optimizing an athlete's recovery and for helping with the decision to return to sport.

  abstract = {Insulin resistance is a common feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes, but novel approaches of diabetes subtyping (clustering) revealed variable degrees of insulin resistance in people with diabetes. Specifically, the severe insulin resistant diabetes (SIRD) subtype not only exhibits metabolic abnormalities, but also bears a higher risk for cardiovascular, renal and hepatic comorbidities. In humans, insulin resistance comprises dysfunctional adipose tissue, lipotoxic insulin signaling followed by glucotoxicity, oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation. Recent studies show that aside from metabolites (free fatty acids, amino acids) and signaling proteins (myokines, adipokines, hepatokines) also exosomes with their cargo (proteins, mRNA and microRNA) contribute to altered crosstalk between skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue during the development of insulin resistance. Reduction of fat mass mainly, but not exclusively, explains the success of lifestyle modification and bariatric surgery to improve insulin sensitivity. Moreover, some older antihyperglycemic drugs (metformin, thiazolidinediones), but also novel therapeutic concepts (new peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, incretin mimetics, sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitors, modulators of energy metabolism) can directly or indirectly reduce insulin resistance. This review summarizes molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance including the roles of exosomes and microRNAs, as well as strategies for the management of insulin resistance in humans. © 2021 The Authors},

It has now become clear that low-grade chronic inflammation is a key player in the pathogenesis of most CNCDs. Given that regular exercise offers protection against all causes of mortality, primarily by protection against atherosclerosis and insulin resistance, we suggest that exercise may exert some of its beneficial health effects by inducing anti-inflammatory actions. Recently, IL-6 was introduced as the first myokine, defined as a cytokine, which is produced and released by contracting skeletal muscle fibres, exerting its effects in other organs of the body. We suggest that skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ and that myokines may be involved in mediating the beneficial effects against CNCDs associated with low-grade inflammation. Copyright © 2008 N.

Methods Eighteen sportsmen performed unilateral jump assessments involving the horizontal squat jump, horizontal countermovement jump, horizontal repetitive jump, vertical squat jump, vertical countermovement jump, and vertical repetitive jump. Results Reliability for the new test was found to be the equal if not better than the other more established tests of leg power, with the within trial variation (CV=1.1–1.9\%) and test–retest reliability (ICC=0.89–0.90). None of the tests were found to have greater discriminative ability in determining limb asymmetries. Stretch shorten cycle enhancement was greater in the vertical tests (12.1\%) compared to the horizontal tests (1.3\%). Horizontal jump assessments (r=−0.73 to −0.86) were found better predictors of 20-m sprint performance than the vertical assessments (r=−0.52 to −0.73), with the horizontal cyclic assessment being the best predictor (r=−0.86).

  abstract = {Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition affecting women. It has traditionally been viewed as a primarily reproductive disorder; however, it is increasingly recognized as a lifelong metabolic disease. Women with PCOS are at increased risk of insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease. Although not currently a diagnostic criterion, IR is a cardinal pathophysiological feature and highly prevalent in women with PCOS. Androgens play a bidirectional role in the pathogenesis of IR, and there is a complex interplay between IR and androgen excess in women with PCOS. Skeletal muscle has a key role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and is also a metabolic target organ of androgen action. Skeletal muscle is the organ responsible for the majority of insulin-mediated glucose disposal. There is growing interest in the relationship between skeletal muscle, androgen excess and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of metabolic disease in PCOS. Molecular mechanisms underpinning defects in skeletal muscle dysfunction in PCOS remain to be elucidated, but may represent promising targets for future therapeutic intervention. In this review, we aim to explore the role of skeletal muscle in metabolism, focusing particularly on perturbations in skeletal muscle specific to PCOS as observed in recent molecular and in vivo human studies. We review the possible role of androgens in the pathophysiology of skeletal muscle abnormalities in PCOS, and identify knowledge gaps, areas for future research and potential therapeutic implications. Despite increasing interest in the area of skeletal muscle dysfunction in women with PCOS, significant challenges and unanswered questions remain, and going forward, novel innovative approaches will be required to dissect the underlying mechanisms. © The Author(s), 2022.},

  abstract = {Exercise is fundamental for good health, whereas physical inactivity underpins many~chronic diseases of modern society. It is well appreciated that regular exercise improves metabolism and the metabolic phenotype in a number of tissues. The phenotypic alterations observed in skeletal muscle are partly mediated by transcriptional responses that occur following each individual bout of exercise. This adaptive response increases oxidative capacity and influences the function of myokines and extracellular vesicles that signal to other tissues. Our understanding of the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms that mediate the skeletal muscle gene expression response to exercise as well as of their upstream signalling pathways has advanced substantially in the past 10 years. With this knowledge also comes the opportunity to design new therapeutic strategies based on the biology of exercise for a variety of chronic conditions where regular exercise might be a challenge. This Review provides an overview of the beneficial adaptive responses to exercise and details the molecular mechanisms involved. The possibility of designing therapeutic interventions based on these molecular mechanisms is addressed, using relevant examples that have exploited this approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.}

Five recent severe episodes prompted further investigation. METHODS: We report the hyperintense white matter (HWM) lesion imaging findings in 50 U-2 pilot volunteers, and compare 12 U-2 pilots who experienced clinical NDCS to 38 U-2 pilots who did not. The imaging data were collected using a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanner and high-resolution (1-mm isotropic) three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence. Whole-brain and regional lesion volume and number were compared between groups. RESULTS: The NDCS group had significantly increased whole brain and insular volumes of HWM lesions. The intergroup difference in lesion numbers was not significant. CONCLUSION: A clinical episode of NDCS was associated with a significant increase in HWM lesion volume, especially in the insula. We postulate this to be due to hypobaric exposure rather than hypoxia since all pilots were maintained on 100\% oxygen throughout the flight. Further studies will be necessary to better understand the pathophysiology underlying these lesions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that U-2 pilot occupational exposure to hypobaria leads to increased incidence of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) with a more uniform distribution throughout the brain irrespective of clinical neurologic decompression sickness history. METHODS: We evaluated imaging findings in 102 U-2 pilots and 91 controls matched for age, health, and education levels. Three-dimensional, T2-weighted, high-resolution (1-mm isotropic) imaging data were collected using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence on a 3-tesla MRI scanner. Whole-brain and regional WMH volume and number were compared between groups using a 2-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test. RESULTS: U-2 pilots demonstrated an increase in volume (394\%; p = 0.004) and number (295\%; p {$<$} 0.001) of WMH. Analysis of regional distribution demonstrated WMH more uniformly distributed throughout the brain in U-2 pilots compared with mainly frontal distribution in controls. CONCLUSION: Pilots with occupational exposure to hypobaria showed a significant increase in WMH lesion volume and number. Unlike the healthy controls with predominantly WMH in the frontal white matter, WMH in pilots were more uniformly distributed throughout the brain. This is consistent with our hypothesized pattern of damage produced by interaction between microemboli and cerebral tissue, leading to thrombosis, coagulation, inflammation, and/or activation of innate immune response, although further studies will be necessary to clarify the pathologic mechanisms responsible.},

  abstract = {Objective Demonstrate that occupational exposure to nonhypoxic hypobaria is associated with subcortical white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods Eighty-three altitude chamber personnel (PHY), 105 U-2 pilots (U2P), and 148 age- controlled and health-matched doctorate degree controls (DOC) underwent high-resolution MRI. Subcortical WMH burden was quantified as count and volume of subcortical WMH lesions after transformation of images to the Talairach atlas–based stereotactic frame. Results Subcortical WMHs were more prevalent in PHY (volume p = 0.011/count p = 0.019) and U2P (volume p {$<$} 0.001/count p {$<$} 0.001) when compared to DOC, whereas PHY were not significantly different than U2P. Interpretation This study provides strong evidence that nonhypoxic hypobaric exposure may induce subcortical WMHs in a young, healthy population lacking other risk factors for WMHs and adds this occupational exposure to other environmentally related potential causes of WMHs.

We tested the hypothesis that a discrete hypobaric exposure will have a transient impact on cerebral physiology. Cerebral blood flow, fractional anisotropy of water diffusion in cerebral white matter, white matter hyperintensity volume, and concentrations of neurochemicals were measured at baseline and 24 hr and 72 hr postexposure in N = 64 healthy aircrew undergoing standard US Air Force altitude chamber training and compared to N = 60 controls not exposed to hypobaria. We observed that hypobaric exposure led to a significant rise in white matter cerebral blood flow (CBF) 24 hr postexposure that remained elevated, albeit not significantly, at 72 hr. No significant changes were observed in structural measurements or gray matter CBF. Subjects with higher baseline concentrations of neurochemicals associated with neuroprotection and maintenance of normal white matter physiology (glutathione, N-acetylaspartate, glutamate/glutamine) showed proportionally less white matter CBF changes. Our findings suggest that discrete hypobaric exposure may provide a model to study white matter injury associated with occupational hypobaric exposure.},

The amount of bone accrued may significantly affect bone mineral status in later life. We carried out a longitudinal investigation of the magnitude and timing of peak bone mineral content velocity (PBMCV) in relation to peak height velocity (PHV) and the age at menarche in a group of adolescent girls over a 6-year period. METHODS: The 53 girls in this study are a subset of the 115 girls (initially 8 to 16 years) in a 6-year longitudinal study of bone mineral accretion. The ages at PBMCV and PHV were determined by using a cubic spline curve fitting procedure. Determinations were based on height (n = 12) and bone (n = 6) measurements over 6 years. RESULTS: The timing of PBMCV and menarche were coincident, preceded approximately 1 year earlier by PHV. Correlation showed a negative relationship between age at menarche and both peak bone mineral accrual (r = -0.42, P {$<$} .002) and PHV (r = -0.45, P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study demonstrated the close association between age at PBMCV and age at menarche and confirmed the relationship between greater PBMCV and PHV in earlier, as compared with later, maturing girls.},

  abstract = {Comparing energy metabolism in human skeletal muscle and primary skeletal muscle cells in obesity, while focusing on glucose and fatty acid metabolism, shows many common changes. Insulin-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and primary myotubes is decreased by obesity, whereas differences in basal glucose metabolism are inconsistent among studies. With respect to fatty acid metabolism, there is an increased uptake and storage of fatty acids and a reduced complete lipolysis, suggesting alterations in lipid turnover. In addition, fatty acid oxidation is decreased, probably at the level of complete oxidation, as (Formula presented.) -oxidation may be enhanced in obesity, which indicates mitochondrial dysfunction. Metabolic changes in skeletal muscle with obesity promote metabolic inflexibility, ectopic lipid accumulation, and formation of toxic lipid intermediates. Skeletal muscle also acts as an endocrine organ, secreting myokines that participate in interorgan cross talk. This review highlights interventions and some possible targets for treatment through action on skeletal muscle energy metabolism. Effects of exercise~in vivo~on obesity have been compared with simulation of endurance exercise~in vitro~on myotubes (electrical pulse stimulation). Possible pharmaceutical targets, including signaling pathways and drug candidates that could modify lipid storage and turnover or increase mitochondrial function or cellular energy expenditure through adaptive thermogenic mechanisms, are discussed. © 2021 The Authors.

Performance of squat, countermovement, and drop jumps with different dropping heights was assessed on the Jump-and-Reach Test and the measurement of flight time, then compared across different jump trials. The very high reliability coefficients of both assessment methods and the lower correlation coefficients between scores on the assessments indicate a very high consistency of each method but only moderate covariation, which means that they measure partly different items. As a consequence, the Jump-and-Reach Test has good ecological validity in situations when reaching height during the flight phase is critical for performance (e.g., basketball and volleyball) but only limited accuracy for the assessment of vertical impulse production with different jump techniques and conditions.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to compare the acute effect of a static- vs dynamic-based stretching warm-up on standing long jump (SLJ) performance in primary schoolchildren. The sample was composed of 76 schoolchildren, 43 girls and 33 boys, aged 9–10 years old from three fourth-grade classes of Primary Education. The three groups were cluster-randomly assigned to the control (CG), static (SG) or dynamic (DG) groups. All the schoolchildren performed a standardized warm-up consisting of mobility exercises (five minutes), jogging (five minutes) and the SLJ test. Afterwards the CG schoolchildren received jump theory (eight minutes), the SG performed static stretching (eight minutes) and the DG performed dynamic-bounces stretching (eight minutes). Afterwards, all of them performed the SLJ test again. The results of the one-way ANOVA (F2,73 = 34.184; p {$<$} 0.001; η2p = 0.484), followed by the pairwise comparisons with the Bonferroni adjustment, showed that the DG students (MΔ = 11.07, SE = 1.42) made a significant statistical improvement in their SJL levels compared with the CG (MΔ = -3.00, SE = 1.89; p {$<$} 0.001, d = 1.51) and SG students (MΔ = -1.85, SE = 0.67; p {$<$} 0.001, d = 1.38). However, statistically significant differences between the CG and SG students were not found (p {$>$} 0.05, d = 0.12). The dynamic-bouncing stretch as a final part of a warm-up improves explosive strength performance in primary schoolchildren, and seems to be a good option before carrying out explosive strength activities of the lower body.},

  abstract = {Purpose of reviewNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steato hepatitis have an increasing prevalence among liver diseases. Overweight and obesity are frequently associated conditions in patients with fatty liver. Skeletal muscle mass depletion may also coexist with chronic liver disease even in obese patients. This review will focus on the relationship between sarcopenic obesity and fatty liver.Recent findingsObesity and sarcopenia are frequently encountered in patients with NAFLD. Adipose tissue is able to release molecules (adipokines) that regulate lipid metabolism, interact with insulin sensitivity and may contribute to induce fibrogenesis in the liver. Skeletal muscle tissue is able to secrete myokines regulating muscle metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Myokines perturbation has been reported to influence adipose tissue mass and fat deposition in the liver. Sarcopenia has been reported as independent risk factor for the development of NAFLD, and for a more severe liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.SummaryThe interaction between skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and the liver may play a role in the development of NAFLD. Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are risk factors for the development of fatty liver and associated with more severe liver fibrosis. Management is not standardized, but dietary counseling and physical training have been proposed as promising strategies. Bariatric surgery may be considered in patients with severe 'resistant' obesity. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Increased physical activity is an optimal way to maintain a good health. During exercise, triacylglycerols, an energy reservoir in adipose tissue, are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids (FAs) which are then released to the circulation, providing a fuel for working muscles. Thus, regular physical activity leads to a reduction of adipose tissue mass and improves metabolism. However, the reduction of lipid reservoir is also associated with many other interesting changes in adipose tissue FA metabolism. For example, a prolonged exercise contributes to a decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity and resultant reduction of FA uptake. This results in the improvement of mitochondrial function and upregulation of enzymes involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The exercise-induced changes in adipocyte metabolism are associated with modifications of FA composition. The modifications are adipose tissue depot-specific and follow different patterns in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Moreover, exercise affects adipokine release from adipose tissue, and thus, may mitigate inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity. Another consequence of exercise is the recently described phenomenon of adipose tissue “beiging,” i.e., a switch from energy-storing white adipocyte phenotype to thermogenic FA oxidizing beige adipocytes. This process is regulated by myokines released during the exercise. In this review, we summarize published evidence for the exercise-related changes in FA metabolism and adipokine release in adipose tissue, and their potential contribution to beneficial cardiovascular and metabolic effects of physical activity. © 2019 Mika, Macaluso, Barone, Di Felice and Sledzinski.

  abstract = {The link between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and sarcopenia has not been extensively studied, but it is evident that they share several common features. Crucial mechanisms involved in sarcopenia-nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) interplay are based on effects of insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and crosstalk between organs by secretion of cytokines (hepatokines, adipokines, and myokines). Currently, published studies confirm the association of sarcopenia with the degree of NAFLD defined by liver histology. However, prospective studies that will give us information regarding the causal effect of NAFLD and sarcopenia are still needed. Furthermore, there is a need for a patient-friendly, noninvasive, low-cost method for detection of loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in the context of NAFLD. Moreover, potential treatment strategies such as physical exercise and nutritional supplementation, that are usually a part of management of sarcopenia, should also be investigated in NAFLD patients, especially given the fact that for now, we do not have a good treatment option for NAFLD. Therefore, future investigations should combine studies on NAFLD and sarcopenia in terms of physical activity and nutritional interventions such as vitamin D supplementation. This review aims to report recent evidence concerning the links between sarcopenia and NAFLD and methods to assess sarcopenia. © 2020 Ivana Mikolasevic et al.},

For rapid cholesterol liver uptake, 6-week-old male C57BL/J6 mice were fed with high-cholesterol/cholic acid (CH) diet for 6 weeks and then were exposed to gradual oxygen level reduction for 1 h and hypoxia at 7\% oxygen for additional 1 hour using a hypoxic chamber. Animals were than sacrificed, and metabolic markers were evaluated. Hypoxic treatment had a strong hypoglycemic effect that was completely blunted by CH treatment. Decreases in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis as well as an increase in ketone body formation were observed. Such changes indicate a metabolic shift from glucose to fat utilization due to activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase/AMPK axis in the CH-treated animals. Increased ketogenesis was also observed in vitro in hepatocytes after cholesterol treatment. In conclusion, our results show for the first time that cholesterol contributes to metabolic shift and adaptation to hypoxia in vivo and in vitro through induction of HIF-1alpha and iNOS expression.},

  abstract = {Currently, many studies draw attention to novel secretory factors, such as adipokines or myokines, derived from the tissues that were not originally recognized as endocrine organs. The liver may contribute to the onset of various kinds of pathologies of type 2 diabetes by way of the production of secretory proteins “hepatokines.” Using the comprehensive gene expression analyses in human livers, we have rediscovered selenoprotein P and LECT2 as hepatokines involved in the onset of dysregulated glucose metabolism. Overproduction of selenoprotein P, previously reported as a transport protein of selenium, induces insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic condition. Selenoprotein P also contributes to vascular complications of type 2 diabetes directly by inducing VEGF resistance in vascular endothelial cells. Notably, selenoprotein P impairs health-promoting effects of exercise by inhibiting ROS/AMPK/PGC-1α pathway in the skeletal muscle through its receptor LRP1. Overproduction of LECT2, previously reported as a neutrophil chemotactic protein, links obesity to insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle. Further studies would develop novel diagnostic or therapeutic procedures targeting hepatokines to combat over-nutrition-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. © 2018, The Japan Diabetes Society.},

  abstract = {Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an incurable and a progressive muscle wasting disease, is caused by the absence of dystrophin protein, leading to recurrent muscle fiber damage during contraction. The inflammatory response to fiber damage is a compelling candidate mechanism for disease exacerbation. The only established pharmacological treatment for DMD is corticosteroids to suppress muscle inflammation, however this treatment is limited by its insufficient therapeutic efficacy and considerable side effects. Recent reports show the therapeutic potential of inhibiting or enhancing pro- or anti-inflammatory factors released from DMD skeletal muscles, resulting in significant recovery from muscle atrophy and dysfunction. We discuss and review the recent findings of DMD inflammation and opportunities for drug development targeting specific releasing factors from skeletal muscles. It has been speculated that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs targeting specific inflammatory factors are more effective and have less side effects for DMD compared with steroidal drugs. For example, calcium channels, reactive oxygen species, and nuclear factor-κB signaling factors are the most promising targets as master regulators of inflammatory response in DMD skeletal muscles. If they are combined with an oligonucleotide-based exon skipping therapy to restore dystrophin expression, the anti-inflammatory drug therapies may address the present therapeutic limitation of low efficiency for DMD. © 2016 Miyatake et al.},

Importantly, skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity relates inversely with pancreatic insulin secretion, which prompted the hypothesis of the existence of a skeletal muscle-pancreas crosstalk mediated through an endocrine factor. The observation that changes in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism are accompanied by altered insulin secretion supports this hypothesis. Meanwhile, a muscle-derived circulating factor affecting in vivo insulin secretion remains elusive. This factor may correspond to peptides/proteins (so called myokines), exosomes and their cargo, and metabolites.

Thirty-four participants were categorised as either experienced (n~=~17) or novice runners (n~=~17). All participants performed a 31-min treadmill run at their individual anaerobic threshold speed, and lower-limb kinematic data were acquired in the sagittal plane at the beginning, middle, and end of the run. Lower-limb coordination and variability during the stance phase were quantified using a vector coding technique for hip-knee, knee-ankle, pelvis-thigh, thigh-shank, and shank-foot couplings. Repeated-measure analysis of covariance revealed that running experience and time had significant interactions on the coordination patterns for hip-knee and pelvis-thigh couplings. During the midstance, experienced runners exhibited a higher percentage of in-phase motion for pelvis-thigh and knee-ankle couplings while novice runners displayed a higher percentage of distal motion for pelvis-thigh coupling and anti-phase motion for hip-knee coupling. Experienced runners displayed more variability in hip-knee and shank-foot couplings, and novice runners had more variability in hip, knee, and thigh motion. Experienced and novice runners adapted to progressive fatigue through different lower-limb coordination patterns. Throughout the prolonged run, experienced runners demonstrated greater coordination variability and novice runners displayed greater joint and segment variability. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

  abstract = {Hypoxia is a critical hallmark of solid tumors and involves enhanced cell survival, angiogenesis, glycolytic metabolism, and metastasis. Hyperbaric oxygen  (HBO) treatment has for centuries been used to improve or cure disorders  involving hypoxia and ischemia, by enhancing the amount of dissolved oxygen in  the plasma and thereby increasing O(2) delivery to the tissue. Studies on HBO and  cancer have up to recently focused on whether enhanced oxygen acts as a cancer  promoter or not. As oxygen is believed to be required for all the major processes  of wound healing, one feared that the effects of HBO would be applicable to  cancer tissue as well and promote cancer growth. Furthermore, one also feared  that exposing patients who had been treated for cancer, to HBO, would lead to  recurrence. Nevertheless, two systematic reviews on HBO and cancer have concluded  that the use of HBO in patients with malignancies is considered safe. To  supplement the previous reviews, we have summarized the work performed on HBO and  cancer in the period 2004-2012. Based on the present as well as previous reviews,  there is no evidence indicating that HBO neither acts as a stimulator of tumor  growth nor as an enhancer of recurrence. On the other hand, there is evidence  that implies that HBO might have tumor-inhibitory effects in certain cancer  subtypes, and we thus strongly believe that we need to expand our knowledge on  the effect and the mechanisms behind tumor oxygenation.},

  abstract = {Objective: Inflammatory cytokines released by hypertrophic adipocytes contribute to low-grade inflammation, a characteristic of Type 2 Diabetes. Skeletal muscle contraction during physical activity stimulates the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines able to counteract this inflammatory status. The aim of this study was to review the evidence of the effectiveness of walking as a physical activity intervention to reduce inflammation. The interplay between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle contributions was also investigated. Method: A structured literature review of papers available up to December 2014 was carried out within the PubMed, Scopus and ISI Web of Science databases using the keywords "walking" and "inflammation" in order to identify the studies involving healthy subjects and subjects diagnosed with, or at increased risk of, Type 2 Diabetes. Results: Thirty-two studies were reviewed, five investigating the acute effects of walking and twenty-seven its chronic effects (n. =. 21 interventional and n. =. 6 observational). Acute effects of walking bouts led to an increase of interleukin-6 in one study, although without any increase in the concentration of the anti-inflammatory marker interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Eight interventional studies showed a significant reduction of inflammation. A reduction in tumour necrosis factor-α concentration was often associated with an adiposity reduction. The observational studies showed that individuals who walk more present a lower inflammatory status. Conclusion: There is no consensus regarding the efficacy of walking in the reduction of low-grade systemic inflammation, even though a relationship cannot be excluded. In each walking bout, no anti-inflammatory effect due to the IL-6-stimulated myokine cascade can be demonstrated. © 2015 .},

  abstract = {Sarcopenia is now clinically defined as a loss of muscle mass coupled with functional deterioration (either walking speed or distance or grip strength). Based on the FRAX studies suggesting that the questions without bone mineral density can be used to screen for osteoporosis, there is now a valid simple questionnaire to screen for sarcopenia, i.e., the SARC-F. Numerous factors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of sarcopenia. These include genetic factors, mitochondrial defects, decreased anabolic hormones (e.g., testosterone, vitamin D, growth hormone and insulin growth hormone-1), inflammatory cytokine excess, insulin resistance, decreased protein intake and activity, poor blood flow to muscle and deficiency of growth derived factor-11. Over the last decade, there has been a remarkable increase in our understanding of the molecular biology of muscle, resulting in a marked increase in potential future targets for the treatment of sarcopenia. At present, resistance exercise, protein supplementation, and vitamin D have been established as the basic treatment of sarcopenia. High-dose testosterone increases muscle power and function, but has a number of potentially limiting side effects. Other drugs in clinical development include selective androgen receptor molecules, ghrelin agonists, myostatin antibodies, activin IIR antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta antagonists, and fast skeletal muscle troponin activators. As sarcopenia is a major predictor of frailty, hip fracture, disability, and mortality in older persons, the development of drugs to treat it is eagerly awaited. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

An important first step in understanding the consequences of early specialization is establishing what early specialization is. Objectives: This PRISMA-guided systematic review aimed to determine the types, characteristics, and general content of early specialization papers within the literature, and examine how early specialization has been defined and measured in order to advance knowledge toward a clear and consistent definition of early specialization. Data sources: Four different electronic databases were searched (SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Sports Medicine and Education Index, and Scopus). Both non data-driven and data-driven studies were included to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the literature. Eligibility Criteria: In order to be included in the review, the paper must: (a) Focus on specialization and explicitly use the term "specialization" (b) Focus on sport and athletes (c) Be papers from a peer-reviewed (d) Be in English. And finally, (e) be available in full text. Results: One thousand three hundred and seventy one articles were screened resulting in 129 articles included in the review after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results indicated a clear discrepancy between key components of early specialization and the approaches used to classify early specializers. Conclusion: Future research should work toward developing a valid and reliable approach to classifying early specializers and establishing a consistent definition across studies.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTExamined from Bio-Ecological System Theory?s PPCT model perspective, this study systematically reviewed how youth sport dropout literature has been theoretically framed; how dropout has been defined and measured; and, mapped all influential factors previously associated (or not) with dropout across and within youth sport. Peer-reviewed literature (N?=?69 studies) published over four decades (1980?2021) residing within five databases was synthesised using a mixed-methods review approach. Existing identified studies examined single or multi-sport (male and female) youth sport contexts worldwide, at different participation levels, although predominantly local club-level. Prior studies predominantly adopted psychological-based theoretical frameworks; often didn?t define dropout; assessed dropout descriptively; and, focused upon the influence of psychological-based factors. From a PPCT perspective, competition structure, relative age (Process), sex, competence perception (Personal), parental socio-demographics, and conflicts with other activities (Context) were frequently identified as influential to dropout across contexts. Although not explicitly utilising the PPCT, sixteen studies examined factors across PPCT levels, with one identifying significant independent influences across the model. Future research is recommended to apply more encompassing (social-ecological) theoretical frameworks; specify dropout definitions and measures; and apply more advanced analytical methods. To help improve study methodological quality, the ?Youth Sport Dropout - Study Checklist (YSD-SC)? is presented.}

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the role of a relative age effect (RAE) and to investigate the influence of biological maturity status on the RAE at the 7(th) International Children`s Winter Games. The birth dates of all 572 participants (365 males, 207 females) were analysed, and the biological maturity status of 384 athletes (243 males, 141 females) was assessed by the age at peak height velocity (APHV) method. A RAE was present in the total sample (χ(2) = 67.81; p {$<$} 0.001), and among both male (χ(2) = 49.02; p {$<$} 0.001) and female athletes (χ(2) = 37.00; p {$<$} 0.001) as well as for strength- (χ(2) = 56.46; p {$<$} 0.001), endurance- (χ(2) = 20.48; p = 0.039) and technique-related types of sports (χ(2) = 20.48; p = 0.041). No significant differences in biological maturity status were present between the male athletes of single relative age quarters. Among the female athletes a significant difference was present (F = 5.94, p {$<$} 0.001); relatively younger female athletes had significantly lower values in the APHV, which indicated that they were maturing earlier. However, when dividing the athletes into normal, early and late maturing athletes, it could be seen that among the relatively younger athletes, hardly any late maturing athletes were present. These findings revealed that relatively younger athletes seemed to only have a chance for selection if they were early maturing, whereas relatively older athletes had an increased likelihood for selection independent of their biological maturity status. In the future, the relative age and the biological maturity status should be considered in the talent development system for various types of winter sport, to contribute to more fairness and to not discriminate against relatively younger and less mature athletes.},

Skeletal muscle produces and releases significant levels of IL-6 after prolonged exercise and is therefore considered as a myokine. Muscle is also an important target of the cytokine. IL-6 signaling has been associated with stimulation of hypertrophic muscle growth and myogenesis through regulation of the proliferative capacity of muscle stem cells. Additional beneficial effects of IL-6 include regulation of energy metabolism, which is related to the capacity of actively contracting muscle to synthesize and release IL-6. Paradoxically, deleterious actions for IL-6 have also been proposed, such as promotion of atrophy and muscle wasting.

  abstract = {Depression is the most common and devastating psychiatric disorder in the world. Its symptoms, especially during the pandemic, are observed in all age groups. Exercise training (ET) is well known as a non-pharmacological strategy to alleviate clinical depression. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the biological factors whose expression and secretion are intensified in response to ET. BDNF is also secreted by contracted skeletal muscle that likely exerts para-, auto-and endocrine effects, supporting the crosstalk between skeletal muscle and other distant organs/tissues, such as the nervous system. This finding suggests that they communicate and work together to induce improvements on mood, cognition, and learning processes as BDNF is the main player in the neurogenesis, growth, and survival of neurons. Therefore, BDNF has been recognized as a therapeutic factor in clinical depression, especially in response to ET. The underlying mechanisms through which ET impacts depression are varied. The aim of this review was to provide information of the biological markers of depression such as monoamines, tryptophan, endocannabinoids, markers of inflammatory processes (oxidative stress and cytokines) stress and sex hormones and their relationship to BDNF. In addition, we reviewed the effects of ET on BNDF expression and how it impacts depression as well as the potential mechanisms mediating this process, providing a better understanding of underlying ET-related mechanisms in depression. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-15 is a cytokine with important immunological functions. It is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and is believed to be a myokine, a hypothesis supported by the rapid increase in circulating levels of IL-15 in response to exercise. Treatment with high doses of IL-15 results in metabolic adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and whole-body fatty acid oxidation and protection from high-fat-diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. IL-15 secreted by contracting muscle may therefore act as an endocrine factor to improve adiposity and energy metabolism in different tissues. Most studies have used supraphysiological doses of IL-15 that do not represent circulating IL-15 in response to exercise. However, evidence shows that IL-15 levels are higher in muscle interstitium and that IL-15 might improve muscle glucose homeostasis and oxidative metabolism in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Nevertheless, how IL-15 signals in skeletal muscle to improve muscle energy metabolism is not understood completely, especially because the absence of the α subunit of the IL-15 receptor (IL-15Rα) results in a phenotype similar to that of overexpressing/oversecreting IL-15 in mice. In this article, we review the literature to propose a model for the regulation of IL-15 by the soluble form of IL-15Rα to explain why some findings in the literature seem, at first glance, to be contradictory. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

  abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-6 has been studied since its discovery for its role in health and diseases. It is one of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 was reported as an exacerbating factor in coronavirus disease. In recent years, it has become clear that the function of muscle-derived IL-6 is different from what has been reported so far. Exercise is accompanied by skeletal muscle contraction, during which, several bioactive substances, collectively named myokines, are secreted from the muscles. Many reports have shown that IL-6 is the most abundant myokine. Interestingly, it was indicated that IL-6 plays opposing roles as a myokine and as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. In this review, we discuss why IL-6 has different functions, the signaling mode of hyper-IL-6 via soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), and the involvement of soluble glycoprotein 130 in the suppressive effect of hyper-IL-6. Furthermore, the involvement of a disintegrin and metalloprotease family molecules in the secretion of sIL-6R is described. One of the functions of muscle-derived IL-6 is lipid metabolism in the liver. However, the differences between the functions of IL-6 as a pro-inflammatory cy-tokine and the functions of muscle-derived IL-6 are unclear. Although the involvement of myokines in lipid metabolism in adipocytes was previously discussed, little is known about the direct relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and muscle-derived IL-6. This review is the first to discuss the relationship between the function of IL-6 in diseases and the function of muscle-de-rived IL-6, focusing on IL-6 signaling and lipid metabolism in the liver. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: The female athlete triad (the triad) is an interrelationship of menstrual dysfunction, low energy availability (with or without an eating disorder), and decreased bone mineral density; it is relatively common among young women participating in sports. Diagnosis and treatment of this potentially serious condition is complicated and often requires an interdisciplinary team. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Articles from 1981 to present found on PubMed were selected for review of major components of the female athlete triad as well as strategies for diagnosis and treatment of the conditions. RESULTS: The main goal in treatment of young female athletes with the triad is a natural return of menses as well as enhancement of bone mineral density. While no specific drug intervention has been shown to consistently improve bone mineral density in this patient population, maximizing energy availability and optimizing vitamin D and calcium intake are recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach involving health care professionals as well as coaches and family members. Prevention of this condition is important to minimize complications of the female athlete triad.},

  abstract = {As our population grows older, age-related pathologies are becoming more prevalent. Deterioration of skeletal muscle and the immune system manifests as sarcopenia and immune senescence respectively. The disease burden of these pathologies emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Skeletal muscle has emerged as a potent regulator of immune system function. As such, skeletal muscle might be the central integrator between sarcopenia and immune senescence in an aging biological system. Therapeutic approaches targeting skeletal muscle might be able to restore both muscle and immune system function. In this review, we therefore outline the current - however still fragmentary - knowledge about the potential communication pathways of muscle and immune system, how they are affected by aging of skeletal muscle and discuss possible treatment strategies.

While resting HR plus 20~bpm is recommended for patients undergoing beta-blocker therapy, the effects of specific beta blockers on HR response to exercise up to the AT (ΔAT HR) in patients with subacute myocardial infarction (MI) are unclear. This study examined whether carvedilol treatment affects ΔAT HR in subacute MI patients. MI patients were divided into two age- and sex-matched groups [carvedilol (+), n\,=\,66; carvedilol (−), n\,=\,66]. All patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing at 1~month after MI onset. ΔAT HR was calculated by subtracting resting HR from HR at AT. ΔAT HR did not differ significantly between the carvedilol (+) and carvedilol (−) groups (35.64\,±\,9.65 vs. 34.67\,±\,11.68, P\,=\,0.604). Multiple regression analysis revealed that old age and heart failure after MI were significant predictors of lower ΔAT HR (P\,=\,0.039 and P\,=\,0.013, respectively), but not carvedilol treatment. Our results indicate that carvedilol treatment does not affect ΔAT HR in subacute MI patients. Therefore, exercise prescription based on HR plus 30~bpm may be feasible in this patient population, regardless of carvedilol use, without gas-exchange analysis data.},

The participants in the Arizona Senior Olympic Games (n = 304) completed an online survey of mental skills use (Athletic Coping Skills Inventory) and grit (Grit Scale-Short). Based on the ongoing validity and reliability issues of the Grit Scale-Short, two regression models were examined, with consistency of interests (passion) and perseverance of effort (perseverance) as dependent variables. After controlling for age and sex, mental skills accounted for 15.2\% of the variance in consistency of interests and 13.1\% of the variability in perseverance of effort.

  abstract = {Objective: To quantify fatigue in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), to determine whether perceived fatigue reflects impairment of physical function and to explore potential causes. Patients and methods: A cohort study was carried out on 156 consecutive patients with histologically proven NAFLD studied in two cohorts. Phase 1 determined the perceived fatigue experienced by NAFLD patients (assessed using the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS)) in comparison with normal and liver disease controls, and the relationship to physical function (actigraphy). In phase 2, biological associations of fatigue in NAFLD were explored. Results: Fatigue was markedly higher in NAFLD patients than in controls (mean (SD) FIS 51 (38) vs 8 (12), p\&amp;lt;0.001). NAFLD patients showed significantly lower physical activity over 6 days (7089 (2909) mean steps/day vs 8676 (2894), p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.02). A significant inverse correlation was seen between FIS and physical activity (r2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.1, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.02). Fatigue experienced by NAFLD patients was similar to that in primary biliary cirrhosis (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}36) (FIS 64 (9) vs 61 (2), p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}NS). No association was seen between FIS and biochemical and histological markers of liver disease severity or insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)) (r2\&amp;lt;0.005). Significant association was seen between fatigue severity and daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) (r2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.2, p\&amp;lt;0.001). Conclusion: Fatigue is a significant problem in NAFLD, is similar in degree to that in primary biliary cirrhosis patients and is associated with impairment in physical function. Fatigue in NAFLD appears to be unrelated to either severity of underlying liver disease or insulin resistance, but is associated with significant daytime somnolence.}

  abstract = {During the past few years, a possible link between skeletal muscle contractile activity and immune changes has been established. This concept is based on the finding that exercise provokes an increase in a number of cytokines. We have suggested that cytokines and other peptides that are produced; expressed and released by muscle fibers and exert either paracrine or endocrine effects should be classified as 'myokines'. Human skeletal muscle has the capacity to express several myokines belonging to distinct different cytokine classes and contractile activity plays a role in regulating the expression of cytokines in skeletal muscle. In the present review, we focus on the myokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-15 and their possible anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory and metabolic roles. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Being physically active and undertaking exercise on a regular basis are critical lifestyle behaviours which protect against the development of numerous chronic metabolic conditions. One of the key mechanisms by which physical activity exerts favourable health effects appears to be due to its capacity to reduce chronic low-grade inflammation. Single bouts of exercise have a potent anti-inflammatory influence with recent advances describing important effects of acute exercise on inflammatory mediators produced within skeletal muscle (myokines), adipose tissue (adipokines) and leucocytes. The accumulated effects of physical activity or exercise training on systemic inflammation have been studied widely within epidemiological research; however, information from intervention trials is still emerging. Current data suggest that the most marked improvements in the inflammatory profile are conferred with exercise performed at higher intensities, with combined aerobic and resistance exercise training potentially providing the greatest benefit. The purpose of this review is to describe recent advances in our understanding surrounding the acute and chronic effects of physical activity on key mediators of inflammation. Within this, particular attention is given to the interleukin-6 system owing to its apparent centrality in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {Osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative musculoskeletal disease characterized by pathological changes in joint structures along with the incidence of which increases with age. Exercise is recommended for all clinical treatment guidelines of osteoarthritis, but the exact molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Irisin is a newly discovered myokine released mainly by skeletal muscle in recent years—a biologically active protein capable of being released into the bloodstream as an endocrine factor, the synthesis and secretion of which is specifically induced by exercise-induced muscle contraction. Although the discovery of irisin is relatively recent, its role in affecting bone density and cartilage homeostasis has been reported. Here, we review the production and structural characteristics of irisin and discuss the effects of the different types of exercise involved in the current study on irisin and the role of irisin in anti-aging. In addition, the role of irisin in the regulation of bone mineral density, bone metabolism, and its role in chondrocyte homeostasis and metabolism is reviewed. A series of studies on irisin have provided new insights into the mechanisms of exercise training in improving bone density, resisting cartilage degeneration, and maintaining the overall environmental homeostasis of the joint. These studies further contribute to the understanding of the role of exercise in the fight against osteoarthritis and will provide an important reference and aid in the development of the field of osteoarthritis prevention and treatment.

  abstract = {Aging causes skeletal muscle atrophy, and myofiber loss can be a critical component of this process. In 1989, Rosenberg emphasized the importance of the loss of skeletal muscle mass that occurs with aging and coined the term 'sarcopenia'. Since then, sarcopenia has attracted considerable attention due to the aging population in developed countries. The presence of sarcopenia is closely related to staggering, falls and even frailty in the elderly, which in turn leads to the need for nursing care. Sarcopenia is often associated with a poor prognosis in the elderly. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the causes and pathogenesis of sarcopenia, and to develop and introduce interventional strategies in line with these causes and pathogenesis. Sarcopenia can be a primary component of physical frailty. The association between sarcopenia, frailty and locomotive syndrome is complex; however, sarcopenia is a muscle-specific concept that is relatively easy to approach in research. In the elderly, a lack of exercise, malnutrition and hormonal changes lead to neuromuscular junction insuf- ficiency, impaired capillary blood flow, reduced repair and regeneration capacity due to a decrease in the number of muscle satellite cells, the infiltration of inflammatory cells and oxidative stress, resulting in muscle protein degradation exceeding synthesis. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction causes metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance, which may lead to quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in skeletal muscle, resulting in sarcopenia. The present review article focuses on age-related primary sarcopenia and outlines its pathogenesis and mechanisms. © 2021 Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Early Sports Specialization (ESS) is a growing concern amongst medical providers. As sports continue to play an increasingly important role in our society and across the globe, the reasons and desires to achieve 'greatness' grow as well. Whether one is driven by the hope of achieving fame and fortune, or merely achieving success in one's sport, more and more individuals are choosing to specialize in a single sport. In a few sports, where flexibility is at a premium - figure skating, gymnastics, and dance, for instance - this early specialization occurs, due to the rules of scoring in those sports, at very young ages. While this could possibly be altered by changing rules or scoring metrics, few other sports require this early specialization. In these sports, while specialization may be beneficial in the short run, it is detrimental in many respects in the longer term. Negative effects include both physical and mental issues, as well as issues with a young athlete's social development. Although many studies have been conducted regarding the problems with ESS and overuse injuries, additional research is needed.

  abstract = {In spite of amazing progress in food supply and nutritional science, and a striking increase in life expectancy of approximately 2.5 months per year in many countries during the previous 150 years, modern nutritional research has a great potential of still contributing to improved health for future generations, granted that the revolutions in molecular and systems technologies are applied to nutritional questions. Descriptive and mechanistic studies using state of the art epidemiology, food intake registration, genomics with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, advanced biostatistics, imaging, calorimetry, cell biology, challenge tests (meals, exercise, etc.), and integration of all data by systems biology, will provide insight on a much higher level than today in a field we may name molecular nutrition research. To take advantage of all the new technologies scientists should develop international collaboration and gather data in large open access databases like the suggested Nutritional Phenotype database (dbNP). This collaboration will promote standardization of procedures (SOP), and provide a possibility to use collected data in future research projects. The ultimate goals of future nutritional research are to understand the detailed mechanisms of action for how nutrients/foods interact with the body and thereby enhance health and treat diet-related diseases. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {The present review addresses mechanisms of importance for hyperthermia-induced fatigue during short intense activities and prolonged exercise in the heat. Inferior performance during physical activities with intensities that elicit maximal oxygen uptake is to a large extent related to perturbation of the cardiovascular function, which eventually reduces arterial oxygen delivery to the exercising muscles. Accordingly, aerobic energy turnover is impaired and anaerobic metabolism provokes peripheral fatigue. In contrast, metabolic disturbances of muscle homeostasis are less important during prolonged exercise in the heat, because increased oxygen extraction compensates for the reduction in systemic blood flow. The decrease in endurance seems to involve changes in the function of the central nervous system (CNS) that lead to fatigue. The CNS fatigue appears to be influenced by neurotransmitter activity of the dopaminergic system, but may primarily relate to inhibitory signals from the hypothalamus arising secondary to an increase in brain temperature. Fatigue is an integrated phenomenon, and psychological factors, including the anticipation of fatigue, should not be neglected and the interaction between central and peripheral physiological factors also needs to be considered.},

Here we propose 5 priority areas of inquiry for the research community and actionable changes to current regulations that will help improve oximeter accuracy. We propose that leading regulatory agencies should immediately modify standards for measuring accuracy and precision of oximeter performance, analyzing and reporting performance outliers, diversifying study subject pools, thoughtfully defining skin pigmentation, reporting data transparently, and accounting for performance during low-perfusion states. These changes will help reduce bias in pulse oximeter performance and improve access to safe oximeters.},

Feedback can provide information relating to the movement outcome (knowledge of results; KR) or information relating to a movement parameter (knowledge of performance; KP). The effect of KR on skill learning has been long studied, but it is unclear whether KP can supplement or substitute KR to enhance learning. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of KR with the effect of KP, and a combination of KR and KP, on motor skill learning. An electronic search was performed on Psychinfo, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and SportDiscuss databases. A total of 19 studies of mixed quality were included. The results showed that a combination of KR and prescriptive KP was superior to KR; prescriptive KP alone was superior to KR; and KR was superior to descriptive KP. We speculate that this finding supports the view that augmented feedback promotes motor learning when it facilitates a learner?s search for goal-relevant movement solutions. Considering the sample included, these results can be generalized only to novices. We encourage future research to examine how skill level and additional classification of KP interact with KR and KP on the learning process.},

  abstract = {1 The present study investigates to what extent and by which time course prolonged strenuous exercise influences the plasma concentration of pro-inflammatory and inflammation responsive cytokines as well as cytokine inhibitors and anti-inflammatory cytokines. 2 Ten male subjects (median age 27.5 years, range 24?37) completed the Copenhagen Marathon 1997 (median running time 3:26 (h:min), range 2:40?4:20). Blood samples were obtained before, immediately after and then every 30 min in a 4 h post-exercise recovery period. 3 The plasma concentrations of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, IL-1ra, sTNF-r1, sTNF-r2 and IL-10 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The highest concentration of IL-6 was found immediately after the race, whereas IL-1ra peaked 1 h post exercise (128-fold and 39-fold increase, respectively, as compared with the pre-exercise values). The plasma level of IL-1?, TNFα, sTNF-r1 and sTNF-r2 peaked in the first hour after the exercise (2.1-, 2.3-, 2.7- and 1.6-fold, respectively). The plasma level of IL-10 showed a 27-fold increase immediately post exercise. 4 In conclusion, strenuous exercise induces an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1? and a dramatic increase in the inflammation responsive cytokine IL-6. This is balanced by the release of cytokine inhibitors (IL-1ra, sTNF-r1 and sTNF-r2) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The study suggests that cytokine inhibitors and anti-inflammatory cytokines restrict the magnitude and duration of the inflammatory response to exercise.},

A number of epidemiological researches have shown that SAS is an important risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), which is associated with SAS regardless of age, gender, or body habitus. IH, hallmark of SAS, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SAS and experimental studies with animal and cellular models indicate that IH leads to attenuation of glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells and to enhancement of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and cells, such as liver (hepatocytes), adipose tissue (adipocytes), and skeletal muscles (myocytes). In this review, we focus on IH-induced dysfunction in glucose metabolism and its underlying molecular mechanisms in several cells and tissues related to glucose homeostasis. © 2019 by the authors.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In their seminal work, McGuire and colleagues reported an increased incidence of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in a cohort of U2 pilots and hypobaric chamber personnel. WMH burden was higher in U2 pilots with previous reports of decompression sickness (DCS), and McGuire's reports have raised concerns regarding adverse outcomes in the aftermath of hypobaric exposures. Accordingly, a NATO working group has recently revised its standard recommendations regarding hypobaric exposures, including measures to mitigate the risk of WMH. Mandatory recovery time for up to 72 h between repeated exposures has been suggested on the basis of experimental evidence. However, we argue that the evidence is scarce which supports restricting repeated exposures to mitigate WMH. It is plausible that WMH is correlated with DCS and emphasis should be made on limiting the duration of exposures rather than restricting short and repeated exposures. The profiles in the NATO recommendations are meant to mitigate the risk of DCS. Still, they will potentially expose NATO Air Force and Special Operations personnel to flight profiles that can give rise to DCS incidence above 35\%. Awaiting reliable data, we recommend limiting the duration of exposures and allowing for short repeated exposures. Ottestad W, Hansen TA, Ksin JI.

  abstract = {Irisin, a PGC1α-dependent myokine, was once believed to have beneficial effects induced by exercise. Since its first discovery of adipose browning in 2012, multiple studies have been trying to explore the metabolic functions of irisin, such as glucose and lipid metabolism. However, recently many studies with irisin concentration measuring were doubt for methodological problems, which may account for the continuous inconsistencies. New tools like recombinant irisin and gene-knockout mice are required to reconfirm the questioned functions of irisin. In this paper, we make a critical introduction to the latest researches concerning the relationship between irisin and coronary heart disease, which includes atherosclerosis, stable angina pectoris and acute coronary syndromes. These studies provided various controversial evidence of short and long-term monitoring and therapeutic effect from molecular cellular mechanisms, in vivo experiments and epidemiological investigation. But with ambiguities, irisin still has a long way to go to identify its functions in the clinical management. © Copyright © 2021 Ou-Yang, Guo, Xu, Lin, Li, Shan, Wu, Wang, Zheng, Xu and Yuan.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms underlying the immunometabolic disturbances during skeletal muscle atrophy caused by a plethora of circumstances ranging from hospitalization to spaceflight missions remain unknown. Here, we outline the possible pathways that might be dysregulated in such conditions and assess the potential of physical exercise to mitigate and promote the recovery of muscle morphology, metabolism and function after intervals of disuse. Studies applying exercise to attenuate disuse-induced muscle atrophy have shown a pivotal role of circulating myokines in the activation of anabolic signalling pathways. These muscle-derived factors induce accretion of contractile proteins in the myofibers, and at the same time decrease protein breakdown and loss. Regular exercise plays a crucial role in re-establishing adequate immunometabolism and increasing the migration and presence in the muscle of macrophages with an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) after disease-induced muscle loss. Additionally, the switch in metabolic pathways (glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS]) is important for achieving rapid metabolic homeostasis during muscle regeneration. In this review, we discuss the molecular aspects of the immunometabolic response elicited by exercise during skeletal muscle regeneration. There is not, nevertheless, consensus on a single optimal intensity of exercise required to improve muscle strength, mass and functional capacity owing to the wide range of exercise protocols studied so far. Despite the absence of agreement on the specific strategy, physical exercise appears as a powerful complementary strategy to attenuate the harmful effects of muscle disuse in different scenarios. © 2022 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

  abstract = {The lack of physical activity and overnutrition in our modern lifestyle culminates in what we now experience as the current obesity and diabetes pandemic. Medical research performed over the past 20 years identified chronic low-grade inflammation as a mediator of these metabolic disorders. Hence, finding therapeutic strategies against this underlying inflammation and identifying molecules implicated in this process is of significant importance. Following the observation of an increased plasma concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in obese patients, this protein, known predominantly as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, came into focus. In an attempt to clarify its importance, several studies implicated IL-6 as a co-inducer of the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance, which precedes the development of type 2 diabetes. However, the identification of IL-6 as a myokine, a protein produced and secreted by skeletal muscle to fulfil paracrine or endocrine roles in the insulin-sensitizing effects following exercise, provides a contrasting and hence paradoxical identity of this protein in the context of metabolism. We review here the literature considering the complex, pleiotropic role of IL-6 in the context of metabolism in health and disease. © 2014 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.

  abstract = {Oxygen, discovered by Joseph Priestley, is the most important gas for human survival. In 1771, Priestley observed that~a mouse in a sealed jar would eventually collapse. He placed a sprig of mint inside, and the subject revived, which led him to discover that plants give off a gas which he named "dephlogisticated air."~This discovery enabled future scientist, Antoine Lavoisier to soon discover that this "dephlogisticated air" is indeed oxygen. It also helped future scientists to understand the importance and the working of cellular respiration and photosynthesis, both essential to life on Earth. The primary purpose of the respiratory system is to take in oxygen and give off carbon dioxide. Oxygen is necessary for cellular metabolism; it acts as the last acceptor of an electron in the electron~transport chain in mitochondria. Without oxygen, the human body metabolizes anaerobically, an unstable stage. If~this continues for some time, cells die. It becomes essential to monitor the levels of oxygen in cases of cardio-respiratory illnesses~by measuring the amount of hemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry. Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive means by which to monitor a person's oxygen saturation. The products of cellular metabolism are water and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an acid, and when it accumulates, it causes respiratory acidosis, which can lead to a lowering of the pH and can have a profound effect on cellular homeostasis and can also lead to cellular death. It becomes essential to monitor the levels of carbon dioxide during procedural sedation through capnography. Capnography is a method of monitoring the concentration or partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the respiratory gases.},

  abstract = {Mitochondria are the cellular powerhouses that generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to substantiate various biochemical activities. Instead of being a static intracellular structure, they are dynamic organelles that perform constant structural and functional remodeling in response to different metabolic stresses. In situations that require a high ATP supply, new mitochondria are assembled (mitochondrial biogenesis) or formed by fusing the existing mitochondria (mitochondrial fusion) to maximize the oxidative capacity. On the other hand, nutrient overload may produce detrimental metabolites such as reactive oxidative species (ROS) that wreck the organelle, leading to the split of damaged mitochondria (mitofission) for clearance (mitophagy). These vital processes are tightly regulated by a sophisticated quality control system involving energy sensing, intracellular membrane interaction, autophagy, and proteasomal degradation to optimize the number of healthy mitochondria. The effective mitochondrial surveillance is particularly important to skeletal muscle fitness because of its large tissue mass as well as its high metabolic activities for supporting the intensive myofiber contractility. Indeed, the failure of the mitochondrial quality control system in skeletal muscle is associated with diseases such as insulin resistance, aging, and muscle wasting. While the mitochondrial dynamics in cells are believed to be intrinsically controlled by the energy content and nutrient availability, other upstream regulators such as hormonal signals from distal organs or factors generated by the muscle itself may also play a critical role. It is now clear that skeletal muscle actively participates in systemic energy homeostasis via producing hundreds of myokines. Acting either as autocrine/paracrine or circulating hormones to crosstalk with other organs, these secretory myokines regulate a large number of physiological activities including insulin sensitivity, fuel utilization, cell differentiation, and appetite behavior. In this article, we will review the mechanism of myokines in mitochondrial quality control and ROS balance, and discuss their translational potential. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Integrins are transmembrane proteins that mediate cellular adhesion and migration to neighboring cells or the extracellular matrix, which is essential for cells to undertake diverse physiological and pathological pathways. For integrin activation and ligand binding, bidirectional signaling across the cell membrane is needed. Integrins aberrantly activated under pathologic conditions facilitate cellular infiltration into tissues, thereby causing inflammatory or tumorigenic progressions. Thus, integrins have emerged to the forefront as promising targets for developing therapeutics to treat autoimmune and cancer diseases. In contrast, it remains a fact that integrin-ligand interactions are beneficial for improving the health status of different tissues. Among these ligands, irisin, a myokine produced mainly by skeletal muscles in an exercise-dependent manner, has been shown to bind to integrin αVβ5, alleviating symptoms under unfavorable conditions. These findings may provide insights into some of the underlying mechanisms by which exercise improves quality of life. This review will discuss the current understanding of integrin-ligand interactions in both health and disease.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Current trends among young athletes towards earlier specialization age and year-round training on multiple teams has raised concern for increased injury risk. Our previous analyses showed higher risk for injury in highly specialized young athletes. The goal of this research was to determine whether sports specialization and injury patterns vary by sports type. METHODS: In this clinical case-control study, injured athletes (aged 7-18 years) were recruited from sports medicine clinics and compared to similarly aged uninjured athletes recruited from primary care clinics. Participants completed a survey reporting age, gender, sport type, specialization patterns, and details regarding sports-related injuries in the previous 6 months. Clinical diagnoses were collected from patients' medical records. Injuries were classified as acute, overuse, or serious overuse. RESULTS: Of 1,190 athletes enrolled, 26\% (313) were single-sport specialized (reported participation in one sport and trained {$>$}8 months/year). Sports with the highest proportion of single-sport specialized athletes were tennis (46.7\%), gymnastics (30.1\%), and dance (26.3\%). Single-sport specialized athletes in individual sports started specializing at a younger age (11.2 +/- 2.4 vs. 12.0 +/- 2.7, p = 0.05) and reported higher training volumes (11.8 vs. 10.3 h/week, p = 0.04) than those in team sports. Sports with the youngest specialization age were gymnastics (8.9 +/- 1.7), dance (10.8 +/- 3.0), and soccer (10.9 +/- 2.4). Single-sport specialized athletes in individual sports accounted for a higher proportion of overuse injuries (44.3\% vs 32.2\%, OR = 1.67, p = 0.037) and serious overuse injuries (23.4\% vs 11.6\%, OR = 2.38, p = 0.011), but a lower proportion of acute injuries (28.8\% vs 13.8\%, OR = 0.37, p = 0.001) compared to single-sport specialized athletes involved in team sports. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes in individual sports may be more likely to specialize in a single sport than team sport athletes. Single-sport specialized athletes in individual sports also reported higher training volumes and greater rates of overuse injuries than single-sport specialized athletes in team sports.},

Understanding of ventilation, perfusion and their relation with each other is important for understanding respiratory physiology. Ventilation to perfusion ratio alters with anaesthesia, body position and with one‑lung anaesthesia. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, an important safety mechanism, is inhibited by majority of the anaesthetic drugs. Ventilation perfusion mismatch leads to reduced arterial oxygen concentration mainly because of early closure of airway, thus leading to decreased ventilation and atelectasis during anaesthesia.

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, colon cancer, breast cancer, dementia and depression constitute a cluster of diseases, which defines 'a diseasome of physical inactivity'. Both physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity, reflecting accumulation of visceral fat mass, are associated with the occurrence of the diseases within the diseasome. Physical inactivity appears to be an independent and strong risk factor for accumulation of visceral fat, which again is a source of systemic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration and tumour growth. Evidence suggests that the protective effect of exercise may to some extent be ascribed to the anti-inflammatory effect of regular exercise, which can be mediated via a reduction in visceral fat mass and/or by induction of an anti-inflammatory environment with each bout of exercise. The finding that muscles produce and release myokines provides a conceptual basis to understand the mechanisms whereby exercise influences metabolism and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. According to our theory, contracting skeletal muscles release myokines, which work in a hormone-like fashion, exerting specific endocrine effects on visceral fat. Other myokines work locally within the muscle via paracrine mechanisms, exerting their effects on signalling pathways involved in fat oxidation. © 2009 The Author.

  abstract = {Exercise is a potent regulator of a range of physiological processes in most tissues. Solid epidemiological data show that exercise training can reduce disease risk and mortality for several cancer diagnoses, suggesting that exercise training may directly regulate tumor physiology and metabolism. Here, we review the body of literature describing exercise intervention studies performed in rodent tumor models and elaborate on potential mechanistic effects of exercise on tumor physiology. Exercise has been shown to reduce tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity, and tumor growth across numerous different transplantable, chemically induced or genetic tumor models.We propose 4 emerging mechanistic effects of exercise, including (1) vascularization and blood perfusion, (2) immune function, (3) tumor metabolism, and (4) muscle-to-cancer cross-talk, and discuss these in details. In conclusion, exercise training has the potential to be a beneficial and integrated component of cancer management, but has yet to fully elucidate its potential. Understanding the mechanistic effects of exercise on tumor physiology iswarranted. Insight into thesemechanistic effects is emerging, but experimental intervention studies are still needed to verify the cause-effect relationship between these mechanisms and the control of tumor growth. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

These diseases constitute a network of related diseases, also called " the diseasome of physical inactivity" In this review, physical inactivity is given the central role as an independent and strong risk factor for accumulation of visceral fat and consequently the activation of a network of systemic inflammatory pathways, which promote development of neurodegeneration as well as insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and tumour growth.

However, the first identified and most studied myokine is the gp130 receptor cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 was discovered as a myokine because of the observation that it increases up to 100-fold in the circulation during physical exercise. Identification of IL-6 production by skeletal muscle during physical activity generated renewed interest in the metabolic role of IL-6 because it created a paradox. On one hand, IL-6 is markedly produced and released in the postexercise period when insulin action is enhanced but, on the other hand, IL-6 has been associated with obesity and reduced insulin action. This review focuses on the myokine IL-6, its regulation by exercise, its signaling pathways in skeletal muscle, and its role in metabolism in both health and disease.},

  abstract = {Neurological and mental illnesses account for a considerable proportion of the global burden of disease. Exercise has many beneficial effects on brain health, contributing to decreased risks of dementia, depression and stress, and it has a role in restoring and maintaining cognitive function and metabolic control. The fact that exercise is sensed by the brain suggests that muscle-induced peripheral factors enable direct crosstalk between muscle and brain function. Muscle secretes myokines that contribute to the regulation of hippocampal function. Evidence is accumulating that the myokine cathepsin B passes through the blood–brain barrier to enhance brain-derived neurotrophic factor production and hence neurogenesis, memory and learning. Exercise increases neuronal gene expression of FNDC5 (which encodes the PGC1α-dependent myokine FNDC5), which can likewise contribute to increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Serum levels of the prototype myokine, IL-6, increase with exercise and might contribute to the suppression of central mechanisms of feeding. Exercise also increases the PGC1α-dependent muscular expression of kynurenine aminotransferase enzymes, which induces a beneficial shift in the balance between the neurotoxic kynurenine and the neuroprotective kynurenic acid, thereby reducing depression-like symptoms. Myokine signalling, other muscular factors and exercise-induced hepatokines and adipokines are implicated in mediating the exercise-induced beneficial impact on neurogenesis, cognitive function, appetite and metabolism, thus supporting the existence of a muscle–brain endocrine loop. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss recent findings with regard to the regulation of muscle-derived interleukin-6 as well as the possible physiological and metabolic roles of interleukin-6 in response to exercise. RECENT FINDINGS: Contraction-induced transcription and release of interleukin-6 is primarily regulated by an altered intramuscular milieu in response to exercise. Accordingly, changes in calcium homeostasis, impaired glucose availability and increased formation of reactive oxygen species are all associated with exercise and capable of activating transcription factors known to regulate interleukin-6 synthesis. Acute interleukin-6 administration to humans increases lipolysis, fat oxidation and insulin-mediated glucose disposal. Adenosine monophosphate- activated protein kinase activation by interleukin-6 appears to play an important role in modulating some of these metabolic effects. Interleukin-6 facilitates an antiinflammatory milieu and may exert some of its biological effects via inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α. SUMMARY: The discovery of contracting muscle as a cytokine-producing organ opens a new paradigm: skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ that in response to contractions produces and releases 'myokines', which subsequently can modulate the metabolic and immunological response to exercise in several tissues. In our view, interleukin-6 may be one of several myokines. © 2007 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

  abstract = {During the past 20 yr, it has been well documented that exercise has a profound effect on the immune system. With the discovery that exercise provokes an increase in a number of cytokines, a possible link between skeletal muscle contractile activity and immune changes was established. For most of the last century, researchers sought a link between muscle contraction and humoral changes in the form of an ?exercise factor,? which could mediate some of the exercise-induced metabolic changes in other organs such as the liver and the adipose tissue. We suggest that cytokines and other peptides that are produced, expressed, and released by muscle fibers and exert either paracrine or endocrine effects should be classified as ?myokines.? Since the discovery of interleukin (IL)-6 release from contracting skeletal muscle, evidence has accumulated that supports an effect of IL-6 on metabolism. We suggested that muscle-derived IL-6 fulfils the criteria of an exercise factor and that such classes of cytokines should be named ?myokines.? Interestingly, recent research demonstrates that skeletal muscles can produce and express cytokines belonging to distinctly different families. Thus skeletal muscle has the capacity to express several myokines. To date the list includes IL-6, IL-8, and IL-15, and contractile activity plays a role in regulating the expression of these cytokines in skeletal muscle. The present review focuses on muscle-derived cytokines, their regulation by exercise, and their possible roles in metabolism and skeletal muscle function and it discusses which cytokines should be classified as true myokines.},

This latter region has its major population density living above 3500 m. The primary objective of the present study is to review the physiology, pathology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of the heart and pulmonary circulation in healthy highlanders and patients with chronic mountain sickness. A systematic review of worldwide literature was undertaken, beginning with the pioneering work done in the Andes several decades ago. Original articles were analyzed in most cases and English abstracts or translations of articles written in Chinese were reviewed. Pulmonary hypertension in healthy highlanders is related to a delayed postnatal remodeling of the distal pulmonary arterial branches. The magnitude of pulmonary hypertension increases with the altitude level and the degree of exercise. There is reversal of pulmonary hypertension after prolonged residence at sea level. Chronic mountain sickness develops when the capacity for altitude adaptation is lost. These patients have moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension with accentuated hypoxemia and exaggerated polycythemia. The clinical picture of chronic mountain sickness differs from subacute mountain sickness and resembles other chronic altitude diseases described in China and Kyrgyzstan. The heart and pulmonary circulation in healthy highlanders have distinct features in comparison with residents at sea level. Chronic mountain sickness is a public health problem in the Andean mountains and other mountainous regions around the world. Therefore, dissemination of preventive and therapeutic measures is essential.},

Exercise can reproduce the phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning, due to the capacity of brief periods of ischemia to reduce myocardial damage caused by acute I/R. In addition, exercise may also activate the multiple kinase cascade responsible for cardioprotection even in the absence of ischemia. Recent Advances: Animal and human studies highlighted the fact that, besides to reduce risk factors related to cardiovascular disease, the beneficial effects of exercise are also due to its ability to induce conditioning of the heart. Exercise behaves as a physiological stress that triggers beneficial adaptive cellular responses, inducing a protective phenotype in the heart. The factors contributing to the exercise-induced heart preconditioning include stimulation of the anti-radical defense system and nitric oxide production, opioids, myokines, and adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) dependent potassium channels. They appear to be also involved in the protective effect exerted by exercise against cardiotoxicity related to chemotherapy. Critical Issues and Future Directions: Although several experimental evidences on the protective effect of exercise have been obtained, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not yet been fully clarified. Further studies are warranted to define precise exercise prescriptions in patients at risk of myocardial infarction or undergoing chemotherapy. © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleotropic cytokine, and in this review, we highlight recent studies focusing on the role of IL-6 in health and disease. IL-6 is known as an exercise-inducible myokine, and in rodents it was identified that a lactate-dependent increase in protease activity mediates IL-6 release from skeletal muscle, which acts in both an autocrine and paracrine roles. In humans, a series of publications observed that blocking IL-6 during exercise training prevented beneficial adaptations, such as reductions in visceral and epicardial fat mass. Independent of exercise, IL-6 impacts postprandial physiology, as demonstrated by a slowing of gastric emptying rate and improving glucose homeostasis. Finally, an engineered cytokine harnessing the biology of IL-6, termed IC7Fc, was found to have beneficial impacts on numerous health outcomes. Together, these recent advances indicate that IL-6 has a multifaceted, and perhaps beneficial, role in health and disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

  abstract = {Irisin is a myokine that leads to increased energy expenditure by stimulating the 'browning' of white adipose tissue. In the first description of this hormone, increased levels of circulating irisin, which is cleaved from its precursor fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5, were associated with improved glucose homeostasis by reducing insulin resistance. Consequently, several studies attempted to characterize the role of irisin in glucose regulation, but contradictory results have been reported, and even the existence of this hormone has been questioned. In this Review, we present the current knowledge on the physiology of irisin and its role in glucose homeostasis. We describe the mechanisms involved in the synthesis, secretion, circulation and regulation of irisin, and the controversies regarding the measurement of irisin. We also discuss the direct effects of irisin on glucose regulatory mechanisms in different organs, the indirect effects and interactions with other hormones, and the important open questions with regard to irisin in those organs. Finally, we present the results from animal interventional studies and from human clinical studies investigating the association of irisin with obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Besides its primary function in locomotion, skeletal muscle (SKM), which represents up to half of human's weight, also plays a fundamental homeostatic role. Through the secretion of soluble peptides, or myokines, SKM interacts with major organs involved in metabolic processes. In turn, metabolic cues from these organs are received by muscle cells, which adapt their response accordingly. This is done through an intricate intracellular signaling network characterized by the cross-talking between anabolic and catabolic pathways. A fine regulation of the network is required to protect the organism from an excessive energy expenditure. Systemic inflammation evokes a catabolic reaction in SKM known as sarcopenia. In turn this response comprises several mechanisms, which vary depending on the nature of the insult and its magnitude. In this regard, aging, chronic inflammatory systemic diseases, osteoarthritis and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies can lead to muscle loss. Interestingly, sarcopenia may persist despite remission of chronic inflammation, an issue which warrants further research. The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) system stands as a major participant in muscle loss during systemic inflammation, while it is also a well-recognized orchestrator of muscle cell turnover. Herein we summarize current knowledge about models of sarcopenia, their triggers and major mediators and their effect on both protein and cell growth yields. Also, the dual action of the JAK/STAT pathway in muscle mass changes is discussed. We highlight the need to unravel the precise contribution of this system to sarcopenia in order to design targeted therapeutic strategies. © 2018 Pérez-Baos, Prieto-Potin, Román-Blas, Sánchez-Pernaute, Largo and Herrero-Beaumont.},

This review provides a comprehensive and integrative overview of how the human body responds to exercise under heat stress and the countermeasures that can be adopted to enhance aerobic performance under such environmental conditions. The fundamental concepts and physiological processes associated with thermoregulation and fluid balance are initially described, followed by a summary of methods to determine thermal strain and hydration status. An outline is provided on how exercise-heat stress disrupts these homeostatic processes, leading to hyperthermia, hypohydration, sodium disturbances, and in some cases exertional heat illness. The impact of heat stress on human performance is also examined, including the underlying physiological mechanisms that mediate the impairment of exercise performance. Similarly, the influence of hydration status on performance in the heat and how systemic and peripheral hemodynamic adjustments contribute to fatigue development is elucidated. This review also discusses strategies to mitigate the effects of hyperthermia and hypohydration on exercise performance in the heat by examining the benefits of heat acclimation, cooling strategies, and hyperhydration. Finally, contemporary controversies are summarized and future research directions are provided.},

  abstract = {The beneficial effects of exercise on the brain are well known. In general, exerciseoffers an effective way to improve cognitive function in all ages, particularly in the elderly, who are considered the most vulnerable to neurodegenerative disorders. In this regard, myokines, hormones secreted by muscle in response to exercise, have recently gained attention as beneficial mediators. Irisin is a novel exercise-induced myokine, that modulates several bodily processes, such as glucose homeostasis, and reduces systemic inflammation. Irisin is cleaved from fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5), a transmembrane precursor protein expressed in muscle under the control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). The FNDC5/irisin system is also expressed in the hippocampus, where it stimulates the expression of the neurotro-phin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in this area that is associated with learning and memory. In this review, we aimed to discuss the role of irisin as a key mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory in the elderly, suggesting its roles within the main promoters of the beneficial effects of exercise on the brain. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Aging and sedentary life style are considered independent risk factors for many disorders. Under these conditions, accumulation of dysfunctional and damaged cellular proteins and organelles occurs, resulting in a cellular degeneration and cell death. Autophagy is a conserved recycling pathway responsible for the degradation, then turnover of cellular proteins and organelles. This process is a part of the molecular underpinnings by which exercise promotes healthy aging and mitigate age-related pathologies. Irisin is a myokine released during physical activity and acts as a link between muscles and other tissues and organs. Its main beneficial function is the change of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue into brown adipose tissue, with a consequential increase in thermogenesis. Irisin modulates metabolic processes, acting on glucose homeostasis, reduces systemic inflammation, maintains the balance between resorption and bone formation, and regulates the functioning of the nervous system. Recently, some of its pleiotropic and favorable properties have been attributed to autophagy induction, posing irisin as an important regulator of autophagy by exercise. This review article proposes to bring together for the first time the “state of the art” knowledge regarding the effects of irisin and autophagy. Furthermore, treatments on relation between exercise/myokines and autophagy have been also achieved. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Regular exercise offers protection against all-cause mortality, primarily by protection against cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The latter disorders have been associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation reflected by a two- to threefold elevated level of several cytokines. Adipose tissue contributes to the production of TNF-α, which is reflected by elevated levels of soluble TNF-α receptors, IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and C-reactive protein. We suggest that TNF-α rather than IL-6 is the driver behind insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and that IL-6 is a marker of the metabolic syndrome, rather than a cause. During exercise, IL-6 is produced by muscle fibers via a TNF-independent pathway. IL-6 stimulates the appearance in the circulation of other anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ra and IL-10 and inhibits the production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. In addition, IL-6 enhances lipid turnover, stimulating lipolysis as well as fat oxidation. We suggest that regular exercise induces suppression of TNF-α and thereby offers protection against TNF-α-induced insulin resistance. Recently, IL-6 was introduced as the first myokine, defined as a cytokine that is produced and released by contracting skeletal muscle fibers, exerting its effects in other organs of the body. Here we suggest that myokines may be involved in mediating the health-beneficial effects of exercise and that these in particular are involved in the protection against chronic diseases associated with low-grade inflammation such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract = {Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a heterogeneous multisystem autoimmune disease whereby its main pathological drivers of disability and damage are vascular injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, and fibrosis. These mechanisms result in diffuse and diverse impairments arising from ischemic circulatory dysfunction leading to painful skin ulceration and calcinosis, neurovascular aberrations hindering gastrointestinal (GI) motility, progressive painful, incapacitating or immobilizing effects of inflammatory and fibrotic effects on the lungs, skin, articular and periarticular structures, and muscle. SSc-related impairments impede routine activities of daily living (ADLs) and disrupt three critical life areas: work, family, social/leisure, and also impact on psychological well-being. Physical activity and exercise are globally recommended; however, for connective tissue diseases, this guidance carries greater impact on inflammatory disease manifestations, recovery, and cardiovascular health. Exercise, through myogenic and vascular phenomena, naturally targets key pathogenic drivers by downregulating multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in serum and tissue, while increasing circulation and vascular repair.

  abstract = {Physical activity—a lifestyle factor that is associated with immune function, neuroprotection, and energy metabolism—modulates the cellular and molecular processes in the brain that are vital for emotional and cognitive health, collective mechanisms that can go awry in depression. Physical activity optimizes the stress response, neurotransmitter level and function (e.g., serotonergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic), myokine production (e.g., interleukin-6), transcription factor levels and correlates [e.g., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor C coactivator-1α [PGC-1α], mitochondrial density, nitric oxide pathway activity, Ca2+ signaling, reactive oxygen specie production, and AMP-activated protein kinase [AMPK] activity], kynurenine metabolites, glucose regulation, astrocytic health, and growth factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor). Dysregulation of these interrelated processes can effectuate depression, a chronic mental illness that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Although the biogenic amine model has provided some clinical utility in understanding chronic depression, a need remains to better understand the interrelated mechanisms that contribute to immune dysfunction and the means by which various therapeutics mitigate them. Fortunately, convergent evidence suggests that physical activity improves emotional and cognitive function in persons with depression, particularly in those with comorbid inflammation. Accordingly, the aims of this review are to (1) underscore the link between inflammatory correlates and depression, (2) explicate immuno-neuroendocrine foundations, (3) elucidate evidence of neurotransmitter and cytokine crosstalk in depressive pathobiology, (4) determine the immunomodulatory effects of physical activity in depression, (5) examine protocols used to effectuate the positive effects of physical activity in depression, and (6) highlight implications for clinicians and scientists. It is our contention that a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which inflammation contributes to the pathobiology of depression will translate to novel and more effective treatments, particularly by identifying relevant patient populations that can benefit from immune-based therapies within the context of personalized medicine. © Copyright © 2018 Phillips and Fahimi.},

Convergent evidence suggests that physical activity offers an affordable and effective method to improve cognitive function in all ages, particularly the elderly who are most vulnerable to neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to improving cardiac and immune function, physical activity alters trophic factor signaling and, in turn, neuronal function and structure in areas critical for cognition. Sustained exercise plays a role in modulating anti-inflammatory effects and may play a role in preserving cognitive function in aging and neuropathological conditions. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that myokines released by exercising muscles affect the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor synthesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a finding that could lead to the identification of new and therapeutically important mediating factors. Given the growing number of individuals with cognitive impairments worldwide, a better understanding of how these factors contribute to cognition is imperative, and constitutes an important first step toward developing non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies to improve cognition in vulnerable populations. © 2014 Phillips, Baktir, Srivatsan and Salehi.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscles contain resident immune cell populations and their abundance and type is altered in inflammatory myopathies, endotoxemia or different types of muscle injury/insult. Within tissues, monocytes differentiate into macrophages and polarize to acquire pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Skeletal muscle macrophages play a fundamental role in repair and pathogen clearance. These events require a precisely regulated cross-talk between myofibers and immune cells, involving paracrine/autocrine and contact interactions. Skeletal muscle also undergoes continuous repair as a result of contractile activity that involves participation of myokines and anti-inflammatory input. Finally, skeletal muscle is the major site of dietary glucose disposal; therefore, muscle insulin resistance is essential to the development of whole body insulin resistance. Notably, muscle inflammation is emerging as a potential contributor to insulin resistance. Recent reports show that inflammatory macrophage numbers within muscle are elevated during obesity and that muscle cells in vitro can mount autonomous inflammatory responses under metabolic challenge. Here, we review the nature of skeletal muscle inflammation associated with muscle exercise, damage, and regeneration, endotoxin presence, and myopathies, as well as the new evidence of local inflammation arising with obesity that potentially contributes to insulin resistance. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

  abstract = {Cancer-induced muscle wasting, i.e. cachexia, is associated with different types of cancer such as pancreatic, colorectal, lung, liver, gastric and esophageal. Cachexia affects prognosis and survival in cancer, and it is estimated that it will be the ultimate cause of death for up to 30\% of cancer patients. Musculoskeletal alterations are known hallmarks of cancer cachexia, with skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as the most studied. Recent evidence has shed light on the presence of bone loss in cachectic patients, even in the absence of bone-metastatic disease. In particular, we and others have shown that muscle and bone communicate by exchanging paracrine and endocrine factors, known as myokines and osteokines. This review will focus on describing the role of the most studied myokines, such as myostatin, irisin, the muscle metabolite β-aminoisobutyric acid, BAIBA, and IL-6, and osteokines, including TGF-β, osteocalcin, sclerostin, RANKL, PTHrP, FGF23, and the lipid mediator, PGE2 during cancer-induced cachexia. The interplay of muscle and bone factors, together with tumor-derived soluble factors, characterizes a complex clinical scenario in which musculoskeletal alterations are amongst the most debilitating features. Understanding and targeting the “secretome” of cachectic patients will likely represent a promising strategy to preserve bone and muscle during cancer cachexia thereby enhancing recovery. © 2021 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.},

  abstract = {Real-time monitoring of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2), also known as capnography, is a valuable hospital tool for assessing patient health during anesthesia and in both the emergency department and critical care units. The fundamental measurement is referred to as end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration that reflects pulmonary gas exchange of CO2 representing systemic metabolism. The shape of the exhaled CO2 concentration for individual inhalation/exhalation breath cycles can offer additional information regarding lung function, airway obstruction, alveolar ventilation, and worsening disease. The most frequent use is to indicate appropriate placement of an endotracheal tube but and it is also employed in the assessment of disease severity and response to treatment (e.g. asthma). Other applications include outpatient monitoring with oxygen supplementation (nasal cannula) and continuous positive airway pressure control for sleep apnea. As technology has evolved, CO2 measurements have become more mobile; capnography systems are now used by emergency medical services personnel for verifying proper placement of airway devices in ‘pre-hospital’ environments. The use of CO2 diagnostics has evolved to identify breathing system disruptions in ‘on-demand’ regulator/masks equipment, both in medical and occupational settings. Most recently, miniaturized tunable laser spectroscopy sensors have been implemented for assessing pilot breathing in high-performance military aircraft. This editorial describes the use of CO2 breath sensors and proposes some new applications based on miniaturized sensors that can be directly inserted into breathing masks.},

  abstract = {Diabetes is a complex disease that affects many organs directly or indirectly. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance with a relative deficiency in insulin secretion. It has become apparent that inter-organ communication is of great importance in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Far from being an inert tissue in terms of inter-organ communication, it is now recognized that skeletal muscle can secrete so-called myokines that can impact on the function of distant organs/tissues both favourably and unfavourably. We have proposed that communication between insulin-resistant skeletal muscle and β-cells occurs in diabetes. This is a novel route of communication that we further suggest is modified by the prevailing degree of insulin resistance of skeletal muscle. This review focuses on the various myokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α, CXCL10, follistatin and IL-8] which have been identified either after different types of exercise or in the secretome from control and insulin-resistant human skeletal myotubes. We will also summarize studies on the impact of several myokines on pancreatic β-cell proliferation, survival and function. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {1. Both hypoxia and hypocapnia can cause broncho-constriction in humans, and this could have a bearing on performance at high altitude or contribute to altitude sickness. We studied the relationship between spirometry, arterial oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) concentration in a group of healthy lowland adults during a stay at high altitude, and then evaluated the response to supplementary oxygen and administration of a β2 agonist2. We collected spirometric data from 51 members of the 1994 British Mount Everest Medical Expedition at sea level (barometric pressure 101.2–101.6 kPa) and at Mount Everest Base Camp in Nepal (altitude 5300 m, barometric pressure 53–54.7 kPa) using a pocket turbine spirometer. A total of 205 spirometric measurements were made on the 51 subjects during the first 6 days after arrival at Base Camp. Further measurements were made before and after inhalation of oxygen (n = 47) or a β2 agonist (n = 39). ETCO2 tensions were measured on the same day as spirometric measurements in 30 of these subjects.3. In the first 6 days after arrival at 5300 m, lower oxygen saturations were associated with lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1; P \&lt; 0.02) and forced vital capacity (FVC; P \&lt; 0.01), but not with peak expiratory flow (PEF). Administration of supplementary oxygen for 5 min increased oxygen saturation from a mean of 81\%–94\%, but there was no significant change in FEV1 or FVC, whilst PEF fell by 2.3\% [P \&lt; 0.001; 95\% confidence intervals (CI) −4 to −0.7\%]. After salbutamol administration, there was no significant change in PEF, FEV1 or FVC in 35 non-asthmatic subjects. Mean ETCO2 at Everest Base Camp was 26 mmHg, and a low ETCO2 was weakly associated with a larger drop in FVC at altitude compared with sea level (r = 0.38, P \&lt; 0.05). There was no correlation between either ETCO2 or oxygen saturation and changes in FEV1 or PEF compared with sea-level values.4. In this study, in normal subjects who were acclimatized to hypobaric hypoxia at an altitude of 5300 m, we found no evidence of hypoxic broncho-constriction. Individuals did not have lower PEF when they were more hypoxic, and neither PEF nor FEV1 were increased by either supplementary oxygen or salbutamol. FVC fell at altitude, and there was a greater fall in FVC for subjects with lower oxygen saturations and probably lower ETCO2.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Irisin is a myokine/adipokine induced by the exercise in mice and humans, which is proposed to induce “browning” of white adipose tissue, its primary target, thus increasing thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Since its identification, irisin has been linked to favorable effects on metabolic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and metabolic bone diseases. Generally, despite the promising profile of irisin in rodents, its effects on human are less recognized. Review: Most, but not all studies show a positive association between irisin and indices of adiposity. In T2DM, NAFLD, and CVD, most observational studies reported lower irisin levels in patients than controls. Regarding metabolic bone diseases, irisin is positively associated with bone mineral density and strength in athletes, and inversely associated with osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis. In PCOS, data remain largely conflicting. Irisin does not seem to be further reduced when two metabolic diseases, e.g., T2DM and NAFLD, or obesity and NAFLD exist though more data are needed. Furthermore, it seems that diverse confounders may have affected the results of different clinical studies. Conclusion: Irisin remains an appealing molecule from a pathophysiological point of view and an appealing therapeutic target for metabolic diseases, albeit much research is still needed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Sarcopenic obesity, a chronic condition, is today a major public health problem with increasing prevalence worldwide, which is due to progressively aging populations, the increasing prevalence of obesity, and the changes in lifestyle during the last several decades. Patients usually present to healthcare facilities for obesity and related comorbidities (type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) or for non-specific symptoms related to sarcopenia per se (e.g., fatigue, weakness, and frailty). Because of the non-specificity of the symptoms, sarcopenic obesity remains largely unsuspected and undiagnosed. The pathogenesis of sarcopenic obesity is multifactorial. There is interplay between aging, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy dietary habits, and insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress, resulting in a quantitative and qualitative decline in muscle mass and an increase in fat mass. Myokines, including myostatin and irisin, and adipokines play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenic obesity. It has been suggested that a number of disorders affecting metabolism, physical capacity, and quality of life may be attributed to sarcopenic obesity, although it is not as yet established whether sarcopenia and obesity act synergistically. There is to date no approved pharmacological treatment for sarcopenic obesity. The cornerstones of its management are weight loss and adequate protein intake combined with exercise, the latter in order to reduce the loss of muscle mass observed during weight loss following diet unpaired with exercise. A consensus on the definition of sarcopenic obesity is considered essential to facilitate the performance of mechanistic studies and clinical trials aimed at deepening our knowledge, thus enabling improved management of affected individuals in the near future. © 2018, Hellenic Endocrine Society.},

  abstract = {Aim: The purpose of the study was to test the effect of ageing, BMI, physical activity and chronic exercise on IL-15 blood concentration by meta-analyses of the literature. Methods: The search was performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, ProQuest, Embase and Cochrane databases. First meta-analysis compared blood IL-15 of healthy adults across three age groups ({$<$}35 years, 35–65 years, and {$>$}65 years), considering BMI as confounding factor; the second compared IL-15 levels between physically active and non-physically active individuals (cross-sectional studies); and the third tested the effect of chronic exercise interventions on blood IL-15 levels on participants of any age, sex, and health condition. Results: From 2582 studies retrieved, 67 were selected for the three meta-analyses (age effect: 59; physical activity cross-sectional effect: 5; chronic exercise effect: 14). Older adults had lower blood IL-15 than young and middle-aged adults (5.30 pg/ml [4.76; 5.83]; 7.11 pg/ml [6.33; 7.88]; 7.10 pg/ml [5.55; 8.65], respectively). However, the subgroup of overweight older adults had higher IL-15 than young and middle aged overweight adults; Habitual physical activity did not affect blood IL-15 (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.61 [−0.65; 1.88], p = 0.34); Chronic exercise reduced blood IL-15 in short-term interventions ({$<$}16 weeks) (SMD -0.14 [−0.27; −0.01], p = 0.04), but not studies of {$>$}16 weeks of intervention (SMD 0.44 [−0.26; 1.15], p = 0.22). Conclusion: The present meta-analyses highlight the complex interaction of age, BMI and physical activity on blood IL-15 and emphasize the need to take these factors into account when considering the role of this myokine in health throughout life. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Tropism and efficiency of skeletal muscle depend on the complex balance between anabolic and catabolic factors. This balance gradually deteriorates with aging, leading to an age-related decline in muscle quantity and quality, called sarcopenia: this condition plays a central role in physical and functional impairment in late life. The knowledge of the mechanisms that induce sarcopenia and the ability to prevent or counteract them, therefore, can greatly contribute to the prevention of disability and probably also mortality in the elderly. It is well known that skeletal muscle is the target of numerous hormones, but only in recent years studies have shown a role of skeletal muscle as a secretory organ of cytokines and other peptides, denominated myokines (IL6, IL8, IL15, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and leukaemia inhibitory factor), which have autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine actions and are deeply involved in inflammatory processes. Physical inactivity promotes an unbalance between these substances towards a pro-inflammatory status, thus favoring the vicious circle of sarcopenia, accumulation of fat - especially visceral - and development of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, dementia and depression, according to what has been called "the diseasome of physical inactivity".},

It was once accepted that on weaning, the 'post-weaned/adult' brain was limited solely to glucose metabolism. However, increasing evidence from conditions of inadequate glucose availability or increased energy demands has shown that the adult brain is not static in its fuel options. The objective of this review is to summarize the body of literature specifically regarding cerebral ketone metabolism at different ages, under conditions of starvation and after various pathologic conditions. The evidence presented supports the following findings: (1) there is an inverse relationship between age and the brain's capacity for ketone metabolism that continues well after weaning; (2) neuroprotective potentials of ketone administration have been shown for neurodegenerative conditions, epilepsy, hypoxia/ischemia, and traumatic brain injury; and (3) there is an age-related therapeutic potential for ketone as an alternative substrate. The concept of cerebral metabolic adaptation under various physiologic and pathologic conditions is not new, but it has taken the contribution of numerous studies over many years to break the previously accepted dogma of cerebral metabolism. Our emerging understanding of cerebral metabolism is far more complex than could have been imagined. It is clear that in addition to glucose, other substrates must be considered along with fuel interactions, metabolic challenges, and cerebral maturation.},

Moreover, glucose metabolism is altered during starvation or diet, resulting in increased plasma ketones (acetoacetate + beta-hydroxybutyrate; BHB). We investigated glucose and lactate adaptation to hypoxia in concurrence with diet-induced ketosis. Male Wistar rats were fed standard (STD), ketogenic (high fat; KG), or carbohydrate-rich (low fat; CHO) diets for 3 wks and then exposed to hypobaric (0.5 ATM) or normobaric atmosphere for 3 wks while on their diets. Lactate, ketones, and glucose concentrations were measured in plasma (mM) and brain tissue (mmol/g). Plasma and tissue ketone levels were elevated up to 12-fold in the KG fed groups compared with other groups (STD and CHO), with the hypoxic KG group reaching the highest levels (2.6 +/- 1.3 mM and 0.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/g; mean +/- SD). Tissue lactate levels in the hypoxic ketotic rats (4.7 +/- 1.3 mM) were comparable with normoxic STD (5.0 +/- 0.7 mM) and significantly lower (ANOVA P {$<$} .05) than the hypoxic STD rats (6.1 +/- 1.0 mM). These data indicate that adaptation to hypoxia did not interfere with ketosis, and that ketosis during hypoxia may lower lactate levels in brain, suggesting decreased glycolysis or increased glucose disposal.},

These myomiRs are known to play regulatory roles in muscle health in general, both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. In this review, we have focused on the significance of a myomiR termed miR-133a in cardiovascular health. The available literature supports the claim that miR-133a could be helpful in the healing process of muscle tissue after injury. The protective function could be due to its regulatory effect on muscle or stem cell mitochondrial function. In this review, we have shed light on the protective mechanisms offered by miR-133a. Most of the beneficial effects are due to the presence of miR-133a in circulation or tissue-specific expression. We have also reviewed the potential mechanisms by which miR-133a could interact with cell surface receptors and also transcriptional mechanisms by which they offer cardioprotection and regeneration. Understanding these mechanisms will help in finding an ideal strategy to repair cardiac tissue after injury. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle injuries are a common manifestation of exercise and non-mechanical factors such as drugs, genetic defects, and systemic diseases. Despite their clinical importance, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of muscle injury and repair are poorly understood, which hamper development of effective clinical interventions. OBJECTIVE: This review is an attempt to recognize basic principles of skeletal muscle regeneration process. METHODS: A thorough systematic review of articles on muscle injury and repair processes was conducted using three reliable search engines for biomedical literature as ScienceDirect, Scopus and PubMed. REVIEW: Following injury, rapid activation and differentiation of satellite cells is major cellular repair process. At the molecular levels, activation of dysferlin and MG53 proteins help in building the ‘’repair cap’’ at injury site to initiate repair process. This event is followed by secretion of muscle myokines and subsequent infiltration of macrophages into muscle fibers, which remove cellular debris and activate other repair proteins and satellite cells. This review elaborates cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating these events following muscle injury. Effective therapeutic interventions to counter muscle injury-related atrophy remain elusive. Conclusion: Altogether, this review proposes cellular and molecular targets to accelerate muscle regeneration process following mechanical and non-mechanical injuries. Further investigations are required to elucidate the pathways dictating muscle regeneration process following injury. © 2021, Khyber Medical University. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The beneficial effects of exercise on human brain function have been demonstrated in previous studies. Myokines secreted by muscle have attracted increasing attention because of their bridging role between exercise and brain health. Regulated by PPARγ coactivator 1α, fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 releases irisin after proteolytic cleavage. Irisin, a type of myokine, is secreted during exercise, which induces white adipose tissue browning and relates to energy metabolism. Recently, irisin has been shown to exert a protective effect on the central nervous system. Irisin secretion triggers an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the hippocampus, contributing to the amelioration of cognition impairments. Irisin also plays an important role in the survival, differentiation, growth, and development of neurons. This review summarizes the role of irisin in neurodegenerative diseases and other neurological disorders. As a novel positive mediator of exercise in the brain, irisin may effectively prevent or decelerate the progress of neurodegenerative diseases in models and also improve cognitive functions. We place emphasis herein on the potential of irisin for prevention rather than treatment in neurodegenerative diseases. In ischemic diseases, irisin can alleviate the pathophysiological processes associated with stroke. Meanwhile, irisin has anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. The potential therapeutic effects of irisin in epilepsy and pain have been initially revealed. Due to the pleiotropic and beneficial properties of irisin, the possibility of irisin treating other neurological diseases could be gradually explored in the future. © 2022 IBRO},

Skeletal muscle secretes myokine during exercise as a large reservoir of signaling molecules, which can be considered as a medium between exercise and brain health. Irisin is a circulating myokine derived from the Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5). Irisin regulates energy metabolism because it can stimulate the “Browning” of white adipose tissue. It has been reported that irisin can cross the blood-brain barrier and increase the expression of a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, which improves learning and memory. In addition, the neuroprotective effect of irisin has been verified in various disease models. Therefore, this review summarizes how irisin plays a neuroprotective role, including its signal pathway and mechanism.

  abstract = {Background: Regular exercise is an effective non-pharmacological therapy for treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The therapeutic benefits of exercise are mediated partly through improved vascular and increase in metabolic health. Release of exercise-responsive myokines, including irisin, is associated with beneficial effects of exercise in CVD patients. Observations: The present review provides an overview of the role of exercise in cardiac rehabilitation of patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Further, the role of irisin as a motion-responsive molecule in improving vascular and metabolic health is explored. Possible mechanism of cardioprotective effect of irisin-mediated exercise on myocardial infarction are also summarized in this review. Conclusion and significance of the review: Irisin is associated with reduced inflammation, antioxidant properties, and anti-apoptotic effect, implying that it is a potential key mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise on vascular and metabolic health. The findings show that irisin is a promising therapeutic target for treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly post-MI. Further research should be conducted to elucidate the potential mechanisms of cardioprotective effects of irisin and explored whether irisin induced by exercise exerts rehabilitation effects post-MI.

  abstract = {Ischemic diseases are a major cause of mortality or disability in the clinic. Surgical or medical treatment often has poor effect on patients with tissue and organ ischemia caused by diffuse stenoses. Promoting angiogenesis is undoubtedly an effective method to improve perfusion in ischemic tissues and organs. Although many animal or clinical studies tried to use stem cell transplantation, gene therapy, or cytokines to promote angiogenesis, these methods could not be widely applied in the clinic due to their inconsistent experimental results. However, exercise rehabilitation has been written into many authoritative guidelines in the treatment of ischemic diseases. The function of exercise in promoting angiogenesis relies on the regulation of blood glucose and lipids, as well as cytokines that secreted by skeletal muscle, which are termed as myokines, during exercise. Myokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand (CXCL) family proteins, irisin, follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), have been found to be closely related to the expression and function of angiogenesis-related factors and angiogenesis in both animal and clinical experiments, suggesting that myokines may become a new molecular target to promote angiogenesis and treat ischemic diseases. The aim of this review is to show current research progress regarding the mechanism how exercise and exercise-induced myokines promote angiogenesis. In addition, the limitation and prospect of researches on the roles of exercise-induced myokines in angiogenesis are also discussed. We hope this review could provide theoretical basis for the future mechanism studies and the development of new strategies for treating ischemic diseases.

  abstract = {Fndc5, a well-defined myokine and also identified as an adipokine, has a critical role in modulation of metabolism and protection against obesity. These important functions are mediated by irisin, a secretory peptide produced from proteolytic processing of Fndc5. The other beneficial physiological effects of irisin are alleviation of oxidative stress, neuroprotective effects, and anti-inflammatory properties and associated anti-metastatic effects. Fndc5/irisin exerts its biological effects through several intracellular signaling pathways. The major signaling pathway is thought to be MAPK signaling pathways which are involved in neural differentiation, browning of white adipocytes, as well as osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Other essential functions of Fndc5/irisin are mediated through additional pathways including AMPK pathway, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3/Snail. Thorough understanding of the mechanisms of irisin actions are essential in order to develop Fndc5/irisin for therapeutic purposes. In the present review, we focus on the current knowledge of the signaling pathways that elicit irisin actions. © 2020 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Significance             Inactivity is a growing public health risk in industrialized societies, leading some to suggest that our bodies did not evolve to be sedentary. Here, we show that, in a group of hunter-gatherers, time spent sedentary is similar to that found in industrialized populations. However, sedentary time in hunter-gatherers is often spent in postures like squatting that lead to higher levels of muscle activity than chair sitting. Thus, we suggest human physiology likely evolved in a context that included substantial inactivity, but increased muscle activity during sedentary time, suggesting an inactivity mismatch with the more common chair-sitting postures found in contemporary urban populations.           ,              Recent work suggests human physiology is not well adapted to prolonged periods of inactivity, with time spent sitting increasing cardiovascular disease and mortality risk. Health risks from sitting are generally linked with reduced levels of muscle contractions in chair-sitting postures and associated reductions in muscle metabolism. These inactivity-associated health risks are somewhat paradoxical, since evolutionary pressures tend to favor energy-minimizing strategies, including rest. Here, we examined inactivity in a hunter-gatherer population (the Hadza of Tanzania) to understand how sedentary behaviors occur in a nonindustrial economic context more typical of humans’ evolutionary history. We tested the hypothesis that nonambulatory rest in hunter-gatherers involves increased muscle activity that is different from chair-sitting sedentary postures used in industrialized populations. Using a combination of objectively measured inactivity from thigh-worn accelerometers, observational data, and electromygraphic data, we show that hunter-gatherers have high levels of total nonambulatory time (mean ± SD = 9.90 ± 2.36 h/d), similar to those found in industrialized populations. However, nonambulatory time in Hadza adults often occurs in postures like squatting, and we show that these “active rest” postures require higher levels of lower limb muscle activity than chair sitting. Based on our results, we introduce the Inactivity Mismatch Hypothesis and propose that human physiology is likely adapted to more consistently active muscles derived from both physical activity and from nonambulatory postures with higher levels of muscle contraction. Interventions built on this model may help reduce the negative health impacts of inactivity in industrialized populations.},

  abstract = {One of the major obstacles that prevents an effective therapeutic intervention against ischemic stroke is the lack of neuroprotective agents able to reduce neuronal damage; this results in frequent evolution towards a long-term disability with limited alternatives available to aid in recovery. Nevertheless, various treatment options have shown clinical efficacy. Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), widely produced throughout the brain, but also in distant tissues such as the muscle, have demonstrated regenerative properties with the potential to restore damaged neural tissue. Neurotrophins play a significant role in both protection and recovery of function following neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke or traumatic brain injury. Unfortunately, the efficacy of exogenous administration of these neurotrophins is limited by rapid degradation with subsequent poor half-life and a lack of blood–brain-barrier permeability. Regular exercise seems to be a therapeutic approach able to induce the activation of several pathways related to the neurotrophins release. Exercise, furthermore, reduces the infarct volume in the ischemic brain and ameliorates motor function in animal models increasing astrocyte proliferation, inducing angiogenesis and reducing neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress. One of the most critical issues is to identify the relationship between neurotrophins and myokines, newly discovered skeletal muscle-derived factors released during and after exercise able to exert several biological functions. Various myokines (e.g., Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1, Irisin) have recently shown their ability to protects against neuronal injury in cerebral ischemia models, suggesting that these substances may influence the degree of neuronal damage in part via inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways. The aim of this narrative review is to examine the main experimental data available to date on the neuroprotective and anti-ischemic role of regular exercise, analyzing also the possible role played by neurotrophins and myokines. © 2020 by the authors.

Such surveillance systems are also active at the organismal level: Nutrient and stress sensing in one tissue can lead to changes in other tissues. Here, we review the emerging understanding of the role of skeletal muscle in regulating physiological homeostasis and disease progression in other tissues. Muscle-specific genetic interventions can induce systemic effects indirectly, via changes in the mass and metabolic demand of muscle, and directly, via the release of muscle-derived cytokines (myokines) and metabolites (myometabolites) in response to nutrients and stress. In turn, myokines and myometabolites signal to various target tissues in an autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine manner, thereby determining organismal resilience to aging, disease, and environmental challenges. We propose that tailoring muscle systemic signaling by modulating myokine and myometabolite levels may combat many degenerative diseases and delay aging. Copyright © 2016 by Annual Reviews.

However, there is an increasing understanding that the mechanisms are more complicated and that statin treatment, in particular when used as primary prevention, is of doubtful benefit. Areas covered: The authors of three large reviews recently published by statin advocates have attempted to validate the current dogma. This article delineates the serious errors in these three reviews as well as other obvious falsifications of the cholesterol hypothesis. Expert commentary: Our search for falsifications of the cholesterol hypothesis confirms that it is unable to satisfy any of the Bradford Hill criteria for causality and that the conclusions of the authors of the three reviews are based on misleading statistics, exclusion of unsuccessful trials and by ignoring numerous contradictory observations.},

  abstract = {It is common for athletes in weight-category sports to try to gain a theoretical advantage by competing in weight divisions that are lower than their day-to-day body mass (BM). Weight loss is achieved not only through chronic strategies (body-fat losses) but also through acute manipulations before weigh-in (“making weight”). Both have performance implications. This review focuses on Olympic combat sports, noting that the varied nature of regulations surrounding the weigh-in procedures, weight requirements, and recovery opportunities in these sports provide opportunity for a wider discussion of factors that can be applied to other weight-category sports. The authors summarize previous literature that has examined the performance effects of weightmaking practices before investigating the physiological nature of these BM losses. Practical recommendations in the form of a decision tree are provided to guide the achievement of acute BM loss while minimizing performance decrements.},

While the recent identification of new 'myokines' has shifted some focus to the role of muscle in this partnership, bone-derived factors and their effects on skeletal muscle should not be overlooked. This review summarizes some previously known mediators of bone-to-muscle signaling and also recent work identifying a new role for bone-derived TGF-β as a cause of skeletal muscle weakness in the setting of cancer-induced bone destruction. Oxidation of the ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR1) in skeletal muscle occurs via a TGF-β-Nox4-RyR1 axis and leads to calcium mishandling and decreased muscle function. Multiple points of potential therapeutic intervention were identified, from preventing the bone destruction to stabilizing the RYR1 calcium channel. This new data reinforces the concept that bone can be an important source of signaling factors in pathphysiological settings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The birth certificate for endocrinology was Bayliss’ and Starling’s demonstration in 1902 that regulation of bodily functions is not only neuronal but also due to blood-borne messengers. Starling named these messengers hormones. Since then transport via blood has defined hormones. This definition, however, may be too narrow. Thus, today we know that several peptide hormones are not only produced and released to blood from endocrine cells but also released from neurons, myocytes, immune cells, endothelial cells, spermatogenic cells, fat cells, etc. And they are often secreted in cell-specific molecular forms with more or less different spectra of activity. The present review depicts this development with the story about cholecystokinin which was discovered in 1928 as a hormone and still in 1976 was conceived as a single blood-borne peptide. Today’s multifaceted picture of cholecystokinin suggests that time may be ripe for expansion of the hormone concept to all messenger molecules, which activate their target cells – irrespective of their road to the target (endocrine, neurocrine, neuronal, paracrine, autocrine, etc.) and irrespective of their kind of activity as classical hormone, growth factorneurotransmitter, adipokine, cytokine, myokine, or fertility factor. © 2021 The authors.},

  abstract = {Chronic low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue (AT) is a hallmark of obesity and contributes to various metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Inflammation in ATs is characterized by macrophage infiltration and the activation of inflammatory pathways mediated by NF-κB, JNK, and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Adipokines, hepatokines and myokines — proteins secreted from AT, the liver and skeletal muscle play regulatory roles in AT inflammation via endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine pathways. For example, obesity is associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory adipokines (e.g., leptin, resistin, chemerin, progranulin, RBP4, WISP1, FABP4, PAI-1, Follistatin-like1, MCP-1, SPARC, SPARCL1, and SAA) and reduced levels of anti-inflammatory adipokines such as adiponectin, omentin, ZAG, SFRP5, CTRP3, vaspin, and IL-10. Moreover, some hepatokines (Fetuin A, DPP4, FGF21, GDF15, and MANF) and myokines (irisin, IL-6, and DEL-1) also play pro- or anti-inflammatory roles in AT inflammation. This review aims to provide an updated understanding of these organokines and their role in AT inflammation and related metabolic abnormalities. It serves to highlight the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of these organokines and their clinical significance. Insights into the roles and mechanisms of these organokines could provide novel and potential therapeutic targets for obesity-induced inflammation.

  abstract = {Exercising regularly is a highly effective strategy for maintaining cognitive health throughout the lifespan. Over the last 20~years, many molecular, physiological and structural changes have been documented in response to aerobic exercise training in humans and animals, particularly in the hippocampus. However, how exercise produces such neurological changes remains elusive. A recent line of investigation has suggested that muscle-derived circulating factors cross into the brain and may be the key agents driving enhancement in synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis from aerobic exercise. Alternatively, or concurrently, the signals might originate from within the brain itself. Physical activity also produces instantaneous and robust neuronal activation of the hippocampal formation and the generation of theta oscillations which are closely correlated with the force of movements. The repeated acute activation of the hippocampus during physical movement is likely critical for inducing the long-term neuroadaptations from exercise. Here we review the evidence which establishes the association between physical movement and hippocampal neuronal activation and discuss implications for long-term benefits of physical activity on brain function. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

On this tissue, this neurotrophin participates on cellular mechanisms related to muscle function maintenance and plasticity as reported on recent scientific works. Moreover, during exercise stimuli the BDNF contributes directly to strengthening neuromuscular junctions, muscle regeneration, insulin-regulated glucose uptake and β-oxidation processes in muscle tissue.

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle plays a major role in controlling body mass and metabolism: it is the most abundant tissue of the body and a major source of humoral factors; in addition, it is primarily responsible for glucose uptake and storage, as well as for protein metabolism. Muscle acts as a metabolic hub, in a crosstalk with other organs and tissues, such as the liver, the brain, and fat tissue. Cytokines, adipokines, and myokines are pivotal mediators of such crosstalk. Many of these circulating factors modulate histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression and/or activity. HDACs form a numerous family of enzymes, divided into four classes based on their homology to their orthologs in yeast. Eleven family members are considered classic HDACs, with a highly conserved deacetylase domain, and fall into Classes I, II, and IV, while class III members are named Sirtuins and are structurally and mechanistically distinct from the members of the other classes. HDACs are key regulators of skeletal muscle metabolism, both in physiological conditions and following metabolic stress, participating in the highly dynamic adaptative responses of the muscle to external stimuli. In turn, HDAC expression and activity are closely regulated by the metabolic demands of the skeletal muscle. For instance, NAD+ levels link Class III (Sirtuin) enzymatic activity to the energy status of the cell, and starvation or exercise affect Class II HDAC stability and intracellular localization. SUMOylation or phosphorylation of Class II HDACs are modulated by circulating factors, thus establishing a bidirectional link between HDAC activity and endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine factors. Indeed, besides being targets of adipo-myokines, HDACs affect the synthesis of myokines by skeletal muscle, altering the composition of the humoral milieu and ultimately contributing to the muscle functioning as an endocrine organ. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the interplay between HDACs and circulating factors, in relation to skeletal muscle metabolism and its adaptative response to energy demand. We believe that enhancing knowledge on the specific functions of HDACs may have clinical implications leading to the use of improved HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of metabolic syndromes or aging.

Noteworthy, it has been shown that aging individuals exhibit a decline in skeletal muscle metabolism, a phenomenon which may be linked to a number of predisposing (risk) factors such as telomere attrition, epigenetic changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, sedentary behavior (leading to body composition alterations), age-related low-grade systemic inflammation (inflammaging), hormonal imbalance, as well as a hypoproteic diet (unable to counterbalance the repercussions of the age-related increase in skeletal muscle catabolism).

  abstract = {Obesity is one of the major pandemics of the 21st century. Due to its multifactorial etiology, its treatment requires several actions, including dietary intervention and physical exercise. Excessive fat accumulation leads to several health problems involving alteration in the gut-microbiota-brain axis. This axis is characterized by multiple biological systems generating a network that allows bidirectional communication between intestinal bacteria and brain. This mutual communication maintains the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and microbial systems of animals. Moreover, this axis involves inflammatory, neural, and endocrine mechanisms, contributes to obesity pathogenesis. The axis also acts in appetite and satiety control and synthesizing hormones that participate in gastrointestinal functions. Exercise is a nonpharmacologic agent commonly used to prevent and treat obesity and other chronic degenerative diseases. Besides increasing energy expenditure, exercise induces the synthesis and liberation of several muscle-derived myokines and neuroendocrine peptides such as neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, ghrelin, and leptin, which act directly on the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Thus, exercise may serve as a rebalancing agent of the gut-microbiota-brain axis under the stimulus of chronic low-grade inflammation induced by obesity. So far, there is little evidence of modification of the gut-brain axis as a whole, and this narrative review aims to address the molecular pathways through which exercise may act in the context of disorders of the gut-brain axis due to obesity.

  abstract = {Purpose of Review: This review summarizes what has been learned about the interaction between skeletal muscle and bone from mouse models in which BMAL1, a core molecular clock protein has been deleted. Additionally, we highlight several genes which change following loss of BMAL1. The protein products from these genes are secreted from muscle and have a known effect on bone homeostasis. Recent Findings: Circadian rhythms have been implicated in regulating systems homeostasis through a series of transcriptional-translational feedback loops termed the molecular clock. Recently, skeletal muscle-specific disruption of the molecular clock has been shown to disrupt skeletal muscle metabolism. Additionally, loss of circadian rhythms only in adult muscle has an effect on other tissue systems including bone. Summary: Our finding that the expression of a subset of skeletal muscle-secreted proteins changes following BMAL1 knockout combined with the current knowledge of muscle-bone crosstalk suggests that skeletal muscle circadian rhythms are important for maintenance of musculoskeletal homeostasis. Future research on this topic may be important for understanding the role of the skeletal muscle molecular clock in a number of diseases such as sarcopenia and osteoporosis. © 2017, The Author(s).},

We examine repeated doubly labeled water (DLW) measurements of TEE in 348 adults and 47 children from the IAEA DLW Database (mean\,±\,SD time interval: 1.9\,±\,2.9\,y) to assess repeatability of TEE, and to examine if TEE adjusted for age, sex, fat-free mass, and fat mass is associated with changes in weight or body composition. Here, we report that repeatability of TEE is high for adults, but not children. Bivariate Bayesian mixed models show no among or within-individual correlation between body composition (fat mass or percentage) and unadjusted TEE in adults. For adults aged 20–60\,y (               N               \,=\,267; time interval: 7.4\,±\,12.2 weeks), increases in adjusted TEE are associated with weight gain but not with changes in body composition; results are similar for subjects with intervals {$>$}4 weeks (               N               \,=\,53; 29.1\,±\,12.8 weeks).

  abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that stretching routines can induce strength and force deficits, although the amount of stretching needed to cause these deficits remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between varying amounts of acute static stretching on jumping performance. By systematically increasing the amount of stretching, possible differences in jump height may be discovered, defining a line where acute static stretching becomes detrimental to performance. Ten collegiate athletes and 10 recreational athletes completed 3 different stretching treatments and 1 control treatment on different days in a within-treatment design. Stretching treatments consisted of 2, 4, or 6 sets of stretches, with each stretch held for 15 seconds with a 15-second rest. Stretches were done to the quadriceps, hamstrings, and plantar flexors. Upon arrival, each subject performed a 5-minute warm-up on a stationary upright cycle. After a brief rest period, participants performed 3 trials of a vertical jump test, followed by one of the treatment protocols. After another rest period, a second set of vertical jump trials was performed. Post-6 sets was significantly lower than Pre-6 sets (p ≤ 0.05). Additionally, Post-6 sets was significantly lower than Pre-4 sets, Pre-2 sets, and Pre-control (p ≤ 0.05). No other conditions were significantly different. In conclusion, 6 sets of stretches, or 90 seconds per muscle group, should not be performed before power activities such as jumping where optimal performance is desired.},

  abstract = {Introduction: An increase in white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on high resolution fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI imaging has been demonstrated in United States Air Force high-altitude U-2 pilots (U2P) compared to matched normative controls (DOC), believed secondary to hypobaric non-hypoxic exposure. Altitude chamber physiology technicians (PHY) exposed to shorter periods of hypobaric non-hypoxic conditions has not been reported. Our hypothesis was the exposure experienced by PHY would demonstrate similar increased subcortical WMH on FLAIR imaging compared to a comparable DOC population but with no significant difference in findings between U2P and PHY. Objective: To compare a population of similar age, medical and neurological history non-exposed controls (DOC) to subjects with a history of hypobaric non-hypoxic exposure (U2P; PHY). Design/Methods: We examined 105 U2P and 83 PHY and compared these to 132 DOC. Quantitative measurement of subcortical FLAIR lesion count and volume was performed as previously described. We applied the 2-tailed nonparametric Mann Whitney statistical test, considering p{$<$}0.05 significant. Results: U2P, PHY, and DOC (respectively): subcortical WMH number: 9.67±18.26; 6.37±11.12; 2.83±3.38; subcortical WMH volume: 0.147cm3±0.296; 0.126cm3±0.404; 0.036cm3±0.061. Significance for subcortical WMH number and volume (respectively): U2P vs. DOC p{$<$}0.001 and p{$<$}0.001; PHY vs. DOC p=0.044 and p=0.033; U2P vs. PHY p=0.091 and p=0.237. Conclusions: The total number and volume of subcortical WMH found in U2P and PHY is significantly greater than in DOC with no significant difference between U2P and PHY. This study provides further evidence that exposure to hypobaria without hypoxia leads to white matter change even in the absence of clinical symptoms. Research is ongoing examining the pathophysiology underlying these structural subcortical changes detected on MRI. Study supported by: AF Surgeon General grant (Log I-11-44).

  abstract = {Increased visceral adiposity may influence the development of prostate cancer (PCa) aggressive tumors and cancer mortality. White adipose tissue (WAT), usually referred to as periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT), surrounds the prostatic gland and has emerged as a potential mediator of the tumor microenvironment. Exercise training (ET) induces several adaptations in both skeletal muscle and WAT. Some of these effects are mediated by ET-induced synthesis and secretion of several proteins, known as myo-and adipokines. Together, myokines and adipokines may act in an endocrine-like manner to favor communication between skeletal muscle and WAT, as they may work together to improve whole-body metabolic health. This crosstalk may constitute a potential mechanism by which ET exerts its beneficial role in the prevention and treatment of PCa-related disorders; however, this has not yet been explored. Therefore, we reviewed the current evidence on the effects of skeletal muscle–WAT–tumor crosstalk in PCa, and the potential mediators of this process to provide a better understanding of underlying ET-related mechanisms in cancer. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle is the largest organ determining whole-body insulin sensitivity and metabolic homoeostasis. Adaptive changes of skeletal muscle in response to physical activity include adjustments in the production and secretion of muscle-derived bioactive factors, known as myokines, such as myostatin, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7 and IL-15, myonectin, follistatin-like 1 or leukaemia inhibitory factor. These myokines not only act locally in the muscle in an autocrine/paracrine manner, but also are released to the bloodstream as endocrine factors to regulate physiological processes in other tissues. Irisin, derived from the cleavage of FNDC5 protein, constitutes a myokine that induces myogenesis and fat browning (switch of white adipocytes to brown fat-like cells) together with a concomitant increase in energy expenditure. Besides being a target for irisin actions, the adipose tissue also constitutes a production site of FNDC5. Interestingly, irisin secretion from subcutaneous and visceral fat depots is decreased by long-term exercise training and fasting, suggesting a discordant regulation of FNDC5/irisin in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Accordingly, our group has recently reported that the adipokine leptin differentially regulates FNDC5/irisin expression in skeletal muscle and fat, confirming the crosstalk between both tissues. Moreover, irisin secretion and function are regulated by other myokines, such as follistatin or myostatin, as well as by other adipokines, including fibroblast growth factor 21 and leptin. Taken together, myokines have emerged as novel molecular mediators of fat browning and their activity can be modulated by adipokines, confirming the crosstalk between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue to regulate thermogenesis and energy expenditure. © 2016 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

Sedentarism is one of the major modifiable risk factors for metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, obesity and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD)–characterized by synaptic failure, amyloid protein deposition and memory loss. Physical exercise promotes neuroprotective effects through molecules released in circulation and mediates the physiological crosstalk between the periphery and the brain. This literature review summarizes the current understanding of the roles of exerkines, molecules released during physical exercise, as systemic and central factors that mediate the beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition. We highlight the neuroprotective role of irisin—a myokine released from the proteolytic cleavage of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) transmembrane protein. Lastly, we review evidence pointing to physical exercise as a potential preventative and interventional strategy against cognitive decline in AD. Copyright © 2022 Rody, De Amorim and De Felice.},

Different types of adipokines, hepatokines, and myokines, which act as cytokines, are secreted from adipose, liver, and muscle tissue, respectively, and have been identified and examined for their physiological roles in humans and disease in animal models. Recently, various studies of these cytokines have been conducted in ruminants, including dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, and goat. Interestingly, a few cytokines from these tissues in ruminants play an important role in the post-parturition, lactation, and fattening (marbling) periods. Thus, understanding these hormones is important for improving nutritional management in dairy cows and beef cattle. However, to our knowledge, there have been no reviews of the characteristics of these cytokines in beef and dairy products in ruminants. In particular, lipid and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue, liver tissue, and muscle tissue are very important for energy storage, production, and synthesis, which are regulated by these cytokines in ruminant production. In this review, we summarize the physiological roles of adipokines, hepatokines, and myokines in ruminants. This discussion provides a foundation for understanding the role of cytokines in animal production of ruminants. Copyright © 2016 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.},

  abstract = {Recent years have demonstrated clear evidence that skeletal muscle is an active endocrine organ. During contraction of muscle fibers, the skeletal muscle produces and releases, into the blood stream, cytokines and other peptides, called myokines, thanks to which it can both communicate with cells locally within the muscle, in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, or with other distant tissues, exerting its endocrine effects. With the progress of sophisticated technologies, the interest towards the skeletal muscle secretome is rapidly grown and the discovery of new myokines represents a prolific field for the identification of new pharmacological approaches for the management and treatment of many clinical diseases. Considering the importance of the muscle proteome and the cross-talk with other organs, the preservation of a skeletal muscle in good health represents a fundamental aspect in life, especially in ageing. Sarcopenia is the age-dependent loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, bringing to increases of the risk of adverse outcomes, such as physical disability and poor quality of life, as well as alteration of several hormonal networks. For that reasons, the scientific community has risen its interest to find new interventions to prevent and manage the sarcopenia. Adequate nutrition during ages plays a fundamental role in the health and function of the skeletal muscle and it can represents, alone or in combination with physical exercise, a possible preventive measure against sarcopenia. This review will overview the endocrinology of the skeletal muscle, making a focus on food intake as a strategy for preventing skeletal muscle decay. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

As a paradigm, the role of adipose tissue in organ crosstalk has been extensively investigated, but tissues such as muscles and the liver are equally important players in this scenario. Perturbation of organ crosstalk is a hallmark of insulin resistance, emphasizing the importance of crosstalk molecules in the modulation of insulin signaling, potentially leading to defects in insulin action. Classically secreted proteins are major cross-talk molecules and are able to affect insulin signaling in both directions. In this review, we aim to focus on some crosstalk mediators with an impact on the early steps of insulin signaling. In addition, we also summarize the current knowledge on the role of extracellular vesicles in relation to insulin signaling, a more recently discovered additional component of organ crosstalk. Finally, an attempt will be made to identify inter‐connections between these two pathways of organ crosstalk and the potential impact on the insulin signaling network. © 2021 by the authors.

Acknowledging that only a few athletes can "make it," the necessity and healthiness of TIDS have recently been questioned based on their increased professionalism, high training, and competition volumes, but limited effectiveness. In this short communication, we suggest that the key issues associated with TIDS are not due to their overall concept, but with how they are designed and implemented. It is recommended that researchers and practitioners determine the worth and value of TIDS by also evaluating the positive health of the athlete rather than solely focusing on performance outcomes. To achieve this, TIDS staff should shape and develop their values, expectations, and day-to-day routines to achieve positive health outcomes focusing on personal development and an athlete-centered culture. In business, this has been termed the concept of "Deliberately Developmental Organisation." TIDS can deploy the factors (e.g., high-quality staff, expert support services, quality facilities, and learning routines) characteristic of such organizations, to concurrently ensure positive impacts and minimize predictable negative outcomes without losing focus on a drive for sporting performance.},

Fatty diets can elicit an inflammatory response in specific hypothalamic cells, including astrocytes, tanycytes, and microglia, disrupting anorexigenic signals in region-specific hypothalamic neurons, contributing to overeating and body weight gain. In this study, we present an update regarding the knowledge of the effects of physical exercise on inflammatory signaling and circuits to control hunger in the hypothalamus in obesity conditions. To try to understand changes in the hypothalamus, we review the use of magnetic resonance/anorexigenic hormone analysis in humans, as well as in animal models to explore the physiological and molecular mechanism by which exercise modulates satiety signals, such as the central anti-inflammatory response, myokine delivery from skeletal muscle, and others. The accumulation of scientific evidence in recent years allows us to understand that exercise contributes to weight control, and it is managed by mechanisms that go far beyond "burning calories."

  abstract = {Adipose tissue is considered an endocrine organ whose complex biology can be explained by the diversity of cell types that compose this tissue. The immune cells found in the stromal portion of adipose tissue play an important role on the modulation of inflammation by adipocytokines secretion. The interactions between metabolic active tissues and immune cells, called immunometabolism, is an important field for discovering new pathways and approaches to treat immunometabolic diseases, such as obesity and cancer. Moreover, physical exercise is widely known as a tool for prevention and adjuvant treatment on metabolic diseases. More specifically, aerobic exercise training is able to increase the energy expenditure, reduce the nutrition overload and modify the profile of adipocytokines and myokines with paracrine and endocrine effects. Therefore, our aim in this review was to cover the effects of aerobic exercise training on the immunometabolism of adipose tissue in obesity and cancer, focusing on the exercise-related modification on adipose tissue or immune cells isolated as well as their interaction. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is growing evidence that bone health is impacted during and after critical illness in multiple ways. In this review, we provide a practical update on postcritical care bone loss with an insight on identification of persons at risk, prevention and treatment strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Critical illness is associated with an increase in bone turnover and with an uncoupling between bone resorption and bone formation. This results in loss of bone mass, as highlighted by changes in bone marker serum levels and in bone mineral density. Data suggest that ICU survivors are at an increased risk of bone fractures, but this is not completely quantifiable. A key driving factor for ICU-related bone loss, beside inflammation, undernutrition and vitamin D deficiency, is immobilization. Bone health and muscle health are closely related, through myokines and osteokines. Even if not completely proven in the context of critical care, it is likely that preserving muscle mass and strength helps reducing bone loss. SUMMARY: A history of critical illness should be considered as a strong risk factor for osteopenia and osteoporosis. ICU-related bone loss should be part of the postintensive care syndrome, and should be targeted by prevention and treatment strategies. Optimized and individualized protein and micronutrient provision (with specific attention to calcium, vitamin D and selenium), associated with physiotherapy and muscle training, should be implemented early after ICU admission and continued after ICU discharge. Antiresorptive agents such as biphosphonates should be considered on an individualized basis.}

  abstract = {The present study summarises the work developed by the ALPHA (Assessing Levels of Physical Activity) study and describes the procedures followed to select the tests included in the ALPHA health-related fitness test battery for children and adolescents. The authors reviewed physical fitness and health in youth findings from cross-sectional studies. The authors also performed three systematic reviews dealing with (1) the predictive validity of health-related fitness, (2) the criterion validity of field-based fitness tests and (3) the reliability of field-based fitness tests in youth. The authors also carried out 11-methodological studies to determine the criterion validity and the reliability of several field-based fitness tests for youth. Finally, the authors performed a study in the school setting to examine the reliability, feasibility and safety of the selected tests. The selected fitness tests were (1) the 20 m shuttle run test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness; (2) the handgrip strength and (3) standing broad jump to assess musculoskeletal fitness, and (4) body mass index, (5) skinfold thickness and (5) waist circumference to assess body composition. When there are time limits, the authors propose the high-priority ALPHA health-related fitness test battery, which comprises all the evidence-based fitness tests except the measurement of the skinfold thickness. The time required to administer this battery to a group of 20 youth by one physical education teacher is less than 2 h. In conclusion, the ALPHA fitness tests battery is valid, reliable, feasible and safe for the assessment of health-related physical fitness in children and adolescents to be used for health monitoring purposes at population level.},

  abstract = {Sarcopenic obesity (SOB), which is closely related to being elderly as a feature of aging, is recently gaining attention because it is associated with many other age-related diseases that present as altered intercellular communication, dysregulated nutrient sensing, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Along with insulin resistance and inflammation as the core pathogenesis of SOB, autophagy has recently gained attention as a significant mechanism of muscle aging in SOB. Known as important cellular metabolic regulators, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) signaling pathways play an important role in autophagy, inflammation, and insulin resistance, as well as mutual communication between skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver. Furthermore, AMPK and PGC-1α signaling pathways are implicated in the gut microbiome–muscle axis. In this review, we describe the pathological link between SOB and its associated complications such as metabolic, cardiovascular, and liver disease, falls and fractures, osteoarthritis, pulmonary disease, and mental health via dysregulated autophagy controlled by AMPK and/or PGC-1α signaling pathways. Here, we propose potential treatments for SOB by modulating autophagy activity and gut dysbiosis based on plausible pathological links. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Exercise activates a plethora of metabolic and signalling pathways in skeletal muscle and other organs causing numerous systemic beneficial metabolic effects. Thus, regular exercise may ameliorate and prevent the development of several chronic metabolic diseases. Skeletal muscle is recognized as an important endocrine organ regulating systemic adaptations to exercise. Skeletal muscle may mediate crosstalk with other organs through the release of exercise-induced cytokines, peptides and proteins, termed myokines, into the circulation. Importantly, other tissues such as the liver and adipose tissue may also release cytokines and peptides in response to exercise. Hence, exercise-released molecules are collectively called exerkines. Moreover, extracellular vesicles (EVs), in the form of exosomes or microvesicles, may carry some of the signals involved in tissue crosstalk. This review focuses on the role of factors potentially mediating crosstalk between muscle and other tissues in response to exercise. © 2022 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

  abstract = {This paper summarizes the various effects of neurotrophins in skeletal muscle and how these proteins act as potential regulators of the maintenance, function, and regeneration of skeletal muscle fibers. Increasing evidence suggests that this family of neurotrophic factors influence not only the survival and function of innervating motoneurons but also the development and differentiation of myoblasts and muscle fibers. Muscle contractions (e.g., exercise) produce BDNF mRNA and protein in skeletal muscle, and the BDNF seems to play a role in enhancing glucose metabolism and may act for myokine to improve various brain disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and major depression). In adults with neuromuscular disorders, variations in neurotrophin expression are found, and the role of neurotrophins under such conditions is beginning to be elucidated. This paper provides a basis for a better understanding of the role of these factors under such pathological conditions and for treatment of human neuromuscular disease.

Recent advances in biological techniques and instrumentation involving nanomaterials, surface plasmon resonance, and aptasensors have developed innovative biosensors over classical methods. Integrated approaches provided a better perspective for developing specific and sensitive devices with wide potential applications. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disease affecting almost every tissue and organ system, with metabolic complications extending far beyond impaired glucose metabolism. Although there is no known cure for Type 2 diabetes, early diagnosis and interventions are critical to prevent this disease and can postpone or even prevent the serious complications that are associated with diabetes. Biomarkers for type 2 diabetes are useful for prediction and intervention of the disease at earlier stages. Proper selection of biomarkers that represent health and disease states is vital for disease diagnosis and treatment by detecting it before it manifests. In this respect, we provide an overview of different types of biosensors being used, ranging from electrochemical, fluorescence-based, nanomonitors, SPR-based, and field-effect transistor biosensors for early detection and management of diabetes with focus on prediabetes. In the future, novel non-invasive technologies combined with blood and tissue-based biomarkers will enable the detection, prevention, and treatment of diabetes and its complications long before overt disease develops. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Objective.—Alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygenation are implicated in altitudeassociated diseases. We assessed the dynamic changes in CBF and peripheral and cerebral oxygenation engendered by ascent to altitude with partial acclimatization and hyperventilation using a combination of near-infrared spectroscopy, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and diffuse correlation spectroscopy. Methods.—Peripheral (SpO2) and cerebral (SctO2) oxygenation, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), and cerebral hemodynamics were studied in 12 subjects using transcranial Doppler and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) at 75 m and then 2 days and 7 days after ascending to 4559 m above sea level. After obtaining baseline measurements, subjects hyperventilated to reduce baseline ETCO2 by 50\%, and a further set of measurements were obtained. Results.—Cerebral oxygenation and peripheral oxygenation showed a divergent response, with cerebral oxygenation decreasing at day 2 and decreasing further at day 7 at altitude, whereas peripheral oxygenation decreased on day 2 before partially rebounding on day 7. Cerebral oxygenation decreased after hyperventilation at sea level (SctO2 from 68.8\% to 63.5\%; P o .001), increased after hyperventilation after 2 days at altitude (SctO2 from 65.6\% to 69.9\%; P ¼ .001), and did not change after hyperventilation after 7 days at altitude (SctO2 from 62.2\% to 63.3\%; P ¼ .35). Conclusions.—An intensification of the normal cerebral hypocapnic vasoconstrictive response occurred after partial acclimatization in the setting of divergent peripheral and cerebral oxygenation. This may help explain why hyperventilation fails to improve cerebral oxygenation after partial acclimatization as it does after initial ascent. The use of DCS is feasible at altitude and provides a direct measure of CBF indices with high temporal resolution.},

However, controversial results and conclusions on circulating irisin concentrations and correlations with other variables, including its role in metabolism, have recently been reported. Although laboratory assessment of irisin by ELISA is easily available and may provide interesting information for therapeutics and clinical practice, the heterogeneous and often discrepant results published so far, raise serious concerns about its measurement, indicating that it may still not be ready for use or whether irisin really exists.

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle can express and release substances such as cytokines or other peptides capable of modulating metabolic processes. These cytokines, named 'myokines', function as hormones either locally within the muscle or by targeting distant organs. A novel peptidic myokine named 'irisin' has been recently identified. It has been noted that circulating irisin levels are lower in type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared with nondiabetic controls as well as in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, a negative correlation between the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and circulating levels of irisin has been also observed. Thus, the blood concentration of irisin may reflect the metabolic status of patients suffering from metabolism disorders. In addition to glycemia or HbA1c, 'irisinemia' may also become a new promising concept employed to monitor metabolic disorders such as T2D or obesity, representing a novel and useful tool in the management of metabolic diseases in the near future. © 2013 S.

  abstract = {Myokines are peptides known to modulate brain neuroplasticity, adipocyte metabolism, bone mineralization, endothelium repair and cell growth arrest in colon and breast cancer, among other processes. Repeated skeletal muscle contraction induces the production and secretion of myokines, which have a wide range of functions in different tissues and organs. This new role of skeletal muscle as a secretory organ means skeletal muscle contraction could be a key player in the prevention and/or management of chronic disease. However, some individuals are not capable of optimal physical exercise in terms of adequate duration, intensity or muscles involved, and therefore they may be virtually deprived of at least some of the physiological benefits induced by exercise. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is emerging as an effective physical exercise substitute for myokine induction. NMES is safe and efficient and has been shown to improve muscle strength, functional capacity, and quality of life. This alternative exercise modality elicits hypertrophy and neuromuscular adaptations of skeletal muscles. NMES stimulates circulating myokine secretion, promoting a cascade of endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine effects. We review the current evidence supporting NMES as an effective physical exercise substitute for inducing myokine production and its potential applications in health and disease. © Copyright © 2019 Sanchis-Gomar, Lopez-Lopez, Romero-Morales, Maffulli, Lippi and Pareja-Galeano.},

  abstract = {Many changes occur during physical exercise in plasma levels of metabolites and hormones, such as increased levels of lactate, growth hormone, cortisol and catecholamine. It has been proposed that the skeletal muscle could act as an endocrine organ secreting proteins ("myokines") that may exert effects on distant sites. In fact, several studies have shown that increased circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL6) is one of the most relevant aspects among the observed plasma changes during an episode of physical activity. During acute exercise, the increase in IL6 concentration exceeded 2-100 times basal values depending on the type, intensity and duration of exercise. In parallel, there was an effect of transient suppression of food intake in the short term through a phenomenon called "exercise-induced anorexia." There are evidences to suggest that IL6 is able to modulate appetite and food intake in the central nervous system, which may be particularly relevant in the short-term regulation of post-exercise energy intake.},

  abstract = {The discovery of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans and the possibility to recruit beige cells with high thermogenic potential within white adipose tissue (WAT) depots opened the field for new strategies to combat obesity and its associated comorbidities. Exercise training as well as cold exposure and dietary components are associated with the enhanced accumulation of metabolically-active beige adipocytes and BAT activation. Both activated beige and brown adipocytes increase their metabolic rate by utilizing lipids to generate heat via non-shivering thermo-genesis, which is dependent on uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Non-shivering thermogenesis elevates energy expenditure and promotes a negative energy balance, which may ameliorate metabolic complications of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) such as insulin resistance (IR) in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Despite the recent advances in pharmacological approaches to reduce obesity and IR by inducing non-shivering thermogenesis in BAT and WAT, the administered pharmacological compounds are often associated with unwanted side effects. Therefore, lifestyle interventions such as exercise, cold exposure, and/or specified dietary regimens present promising anchor points for future disease prevention and treatment of obesity and T2DM. The exact mechanisms where exercise, cold exposure, dietary interventions, and pharmacological treatments converge or rather diverge in their specific impact on BAT activation or WAT browning are difficult to determine. In the past, many reviews have demonstrated the mechanistic principles of exercise-and/or cold-induced BAT activation and WAT browning. In this review, we aim to summarize not only the current state of knowledge on the various mechanistic principles of diverse external stimuli on BAT activation and WAT browning, but also present their translational potential in future clinical applications. © 2022 by the authors.

Our study aimed at testing the AT in another profile of exercise, viz., during exercises at constant workloads.A homogenous population of 66 healthy subjects performed on a treadmill a total of 100 exercises of 20 min duration at constant workloads (43, 48, 52, 57, 63, and 71\% \$\$\textbackslash dot V\$\$O2 and with a sustained increase of lactate until the end of exercise.The meaning of the simultaneity of these three events must still be studied. However, the dissociation between both early and steady-state lactate thresholds and HVT is not in keeping with the concept of AT. In these conditions, there is no evidence that HVT necessarily represents an AT, viz., a critical intensity of exercise inducing an insufficient oxygen delivery to the muscles. This conclusion does not imply that the measurement of HVT should be rejected as an empirical test of physical fitness.},

  abstract = {The Canadian Olympic Men's Boxing Team was once among the most successful contingents in the world in its sport discipline but then lost this prominent status. At present, Canada's Boxing Team has begun preparation for the 2016 Olympics with the “Own the Podium” (OTP) Program providing financial support to the National Boxing Team and targeted Olympic candidates expected to podium at the 2016 Olympic Games. The authors reveal in this paper the first step of the project “Psychological Support for the Canadian Olympic Boxing Team in Meta-Transitions through the National Team Program” aimed at planning for the boxers' progressions through the 2013–2016 Olympic cycle. Integral to this program, the athletes' progressions are supported through the development of a system of National Team Psychological Support Services (NT-PSS). Within this submission, the authors further develop a vision of the 2016 Olympic Games as a career transition and consider how the Canadian Men's Boxing Team's staff, located within a broader national sport system, proactively map six meta-transitions for the boxers throughout the 2013–2016 Olympic cycle and plan the NT-PSS' content accordingly. The forthcoming meta-transitions are seen as turns between the phases of progressing Olympic cycle: (A) entering the National Team Program, (B) entering major international tournaments, (C) Olympic qualification, (D) focused preparation for the Olympics, (E) to the Olympic podium, and (F) to the post-Games.

ScO2 readings are based on the fraction of reduced and oxidized hemoglobin as an indirect estimate of brain tissue oxygenation and assume a static ratio of arterial to venous intracranial blood. Conditions that alter cerebral blood flow, such as acute changes in Paco2, may decrease accuracy. We assessed the performance of two commercial cerebral oximeters across a range of oxygen concentrations during normocapnia and hypocapnia.Casmed FORE-SIGHT Elite (CAS Medical Systems, Inc., USA) and Covidien INVOS 5100C (Covidien, USA) oximeter sensors were placed on 12 healthy volunteers. The fractional inspired oxygen tension was varied to achieve seven steady-state levels including hypoxic and hyperoxic Pao2 values. ScO2 and simultaneous arterial and jugular venous blood gas measurements were obtained with both normocapnia and hypocapnia. Oximeter bias was calculated as the difference between the ScO2 and reference saturation using manufacturer-specified weighting ratios from the arterial and venous samples.FORE-SIGHT Elite bias was greater during hypocapnia as compared with normocapnia (4\,±\,9\% vs. 0\,±\,6\%; P \&lt; 0.001). The INVOS 5100C bias was also lower during normocapnia (5\,±\,15\% vs. 3\,±\,12\%; P = 0.01). Hypocapnia resulted in a significant decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen tension, as well as increased oxygen extraction across fractional inspired oxygen tension levels (P \&lt; 0.0001). Bias increased significantly with increasing oxygen extraction (P \&lt; 0.0001).Changes in Paco2 affect cerebral oximeter accuracy, and increased bias occurs with hypocapnia. Decreased accuracy may represent an incorrect assumption of a static arterial–venous blood fraction. Understanding cerebral oximetry limitations is especially important in patients at risk for hypoxia-induced brain injury, where Paco2 may be purposefully altered.},

  abstract = {It is well established that regimented resistance training can promote increases in muscle hypertrophy. The prevailing body of research indicates that mechanical stress is the primary impetus for this adaptive response and studies show that mechanical stress alone can initiate anabolic signalling. Given the dominant role of mechanical stress in muscle growth, the question arises as to whether other factors may enhance the post-exercise hypertrophic response. Several researchers have proposed that exercise-induced metabolic stress may in fact confer such an anabolic effect and some have even suggested that metabolite accumulation may be more important than high force development in optimizing muscle growth. Metabolic stress pursuant to traditional resistance training manifests as a result of exercise that relies on anaerobic glycolysis for adenosine triphosphate production. This, in turn, causes the subsequent accumulation of metabolites, particularly lactate and H+. Acute muscle hypoxia associated with such training methods may further heighten metabolic buildup. Therefore, the purpose of this paper will be to review the emerging body of research suggesting a role for exercise-induced metabolic stress in maximizing muscle development and present insights as to the potential mechanisms by which these hypertrophic adaptations may occur. These mechanisms include increased fibre recruitment, elevated systemic hormonal production, alterations in local myokines, heightened production of reactive oxygen species and cell swelling.

Sarcopenia is associated with cognitive impairment, defined as a decline in one or more cognitive domains as language, memory, reasoning, social cognition, planning, making decisions, and solving problems.

Moreover, studies conducted on physical exercise supported the existence of muscle‐brain cross‐talk, showing how physical activity, changing myokinesʹ circulating levels, exerts beneficial effects on the brain.

  abstract = {It is now established that adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and heart are endocrine organs and secrete in normal and in pathological conditions several molecules, called, respectively, adipokines, myokines, and cardiokines. These secretory proteins constitute a closed network that plays a crucial role in obesity and above all in cardiac diseases associated with obesity. In particular, the interaction between adipokines, myokines, and cardiokines is mainly involved in inflammatory and oxidative damage characterized obesity condition. Identifying new therapeutic agents or treatment having a positive action on the expression of these molecules could have a key positive effect on the management of obesity and its cardiac complications. Results from recent studies indicate that several nutritional interventions, including nutraceutical supplements, could represent new therapeutic agents on the adipo-myo-cardiokines network. This review focuses the biological action on the main adipokines, myokines and cardiokines involved in obesity and cardiovascular diseases and describe the principal nutraceutical approaches able to regulate leptin, adiponectin, apelin, irisin, natriuretic peptides, and follistatin-like 1 expression. © 2020, MDPI AG.

  abstract = {The efficacy and optimization of poststroke physical therapy paradigms is challenged in part by a lack of objective tools available to researchers for systematic preclinical testing. This work represents a maiden effort to develop a robot-Assisted mechanical therapy (RAMT) device to objectively address the significance of mechanical physiotherapy on poststroke outcomes. Wistar rats were subjected to right hemisphere middle-cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion. After 24 h, rats were split into control (RAMT2) orRAMT+ groups (30min daily RAMT over the stroke-Affected gastrocnemius) and were followed up to poststroke d 14. RAMT+ increased perfusion 1.5- fold in stroke-Affected gastrocnemius as compared to RAMT2 controls. Furthermore, RAMT+ rats demonstrated improved poststroke track width (11\% wider), stride length (21\% longer), and travel distance (61\% greater), as objectively measured using software-Automated testing platforms. Stroke injury acutely increased myostatin (3-fold) and lowered brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression (0.6-fold) in the stroke-Affected gastrocnemius, as compared to the contralateral one. RAMT attenuated the stroke-induced increase in myostatin and increased BDNF expression in skeletal muscle. Additional RAMT-sensitive myokine targets in skeletal muscle (IL-1ra and IP-10/CXCL10) were identified from a cytokine array. Taken together, outcomes suggest stroke acutely influences signal transduction in hindlimb skeletal muscle. Regimens based onmechanical therapy have the clear potential to protect hindlimb function from such adverse influence.},

World War I fatal crashes of high altitude fighter pilots led to a century of efforts to use oximetry to warn pilots. The carotid body, discovered in 1932 to be the hypoxia detector, led to most current physiologic understanding of the body's respiratory responses to hypoxia and CO2. The author describes some of his UCSF group's work: In 1963, we reported both the brain's ventral medullary near-surface CO2 (and pH) chemosensors and the role of cerebrospinal fluid in acclimatization to altitude. In 1966, we reported the effect of altitude on cerebral blood flow and later the changes of carotid body sensitivity at altitude and the differences in natives of high altitude. In 1973, pulse oximetry was invented when Japanese biophysicist Takuo Aoyagi read and applied to pulses a largely forgotten 35-year-old discovery by English medical student J. R. Squire of a method of computing oxygen saturation from red and infrared light passing through both perfused and blanched tissue.},

Deaths came with curare and potent anesthetic respiratory arrest. Leland Clark's invention of a polarographic blood oxygen tension electrode (1954) was introduced for transcutaneous PO2 monitoring to adjust PEEP and CPAP PO2 to prevent premature infant blindness from excess O2 (1972). Oximetry for warning military aviators was tried after WW II but not used for routine monitoring until Takuo Aoyagi (1973) discovered an equation to measure SaO2 by the ratio of ratios of red and IR light transmitted through tissue as it changed with arterial pulses. Pulse oximetry (1982) depended on simultaneous technology improvements of light emitting red and IR diodes, tiny cheap solid state sensors and micro-chip computers. Continuous monitoring of airway anesthetic concentration and oxygen also became very common after 1980. Death from anesthesia fell 10 fold between 1985 and 2000 as pulse oximetry became universally used, but no proof of a causative relationship to pulse oximetry exists. It is now assumed that all anesthesiologist became much more aware of the dangers of prolonged hypoxia, perhaps by using the pulse oximeters.},

  abstract = {The hyperbolic hypoxic ventilatory response vs PaO2, HVRp, is interpreted as relecting a mass hyperbolic relationship of cytochrome PcO2 to cytochrome potential Ec, offset 32 torr by the constant diffusion gradient between arterial blood and cytochrome in CB at its constant metabolic rate \$\$\textbackslash dot VO\_2 \$\$. Ec is taken to be a linear function of redox reduction and CB ventilatory drive. As Ec rises in hypoxia, the absolute potentials of each step in the citric acid cycle rises equally while the potential drop across each step remains constant because flux rate remains constant. A hypothetic HVRs (\$\$\textbackslash dot VE\$\$vs SaO2) response curve computed from these assumptions is strikingly non linear. A hypothetic HVRp calculated from an assumed linear HVRs cannot be fit to the observed hyperbolic increase of ventilation in response to isocapnic hypoxia at PO2 less than 40 torr. The incompatibility of these results suggest that in future studies HVRs will not be found to be linear, especially below 80\% SaO2 and HVRp will fail to be accurately hyperbolic.},

  abstract = {In the 1930s and 1940s, photo cells permitted German, English, and American physiologists to construct ear oximeters with red and infrared light, requiring calibration. In 1940 Squire recognized that changes of red and infrared light transmission caused by pneumatic tissue compression permitted saturation to be computed. In 1949 Wood used this idea to compute absolute saturation continuously from the ratios of optical density changes with pressure in an ear oximeter. In 1972 Takuo Aoyagi, an electrical engineer at Nihon Kohden company in Tokyo, was interested in measuring cardiac output noninvasively by the dye dilution method using a commercially available ear oximeter. He balanced the red and infrared signals to cancel the pulse noise which prevented measuring the dye washout accurately. He discovered that changes of oxygen saturation voided his pulse cancellation. He then realized that these pulsatile changes could be used to compute saturation from the ratio of ratios of pulse changes in the red and infrared. His ideas, equations and instrument were adapted, improved and successfully marketed by Minolta about 1978, stimulating other firms to further improve and market pulse oximeters worldwide in the mid 1980s. Dr. Aoyagi and associates provided a detailed history for this paper.},

Emerging evidence in the literature points at additional factors and environmental conditions stimulating browning in rodents, including physical exercise training. Exercise engages sympathetic activation which during cold activation promotes proliferation and differentiation of brown preadipocytes. Exercise also stimulates the release of multiple growth factors and cytokines. Importantly, there are clear discrepancies between human and rodents with regard to thermogenic capacity and browning potential. Here we provide a translational perspective on exercise-induced browning and review recent findings on the role of myokines and hepatokines in this process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd}

  abstract = {Physical activity decreases the risk of a network of diseases, and exercise may be prescribed as medicine for lifestyle-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes, dementia, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. During the past couple of decades, it has been apparent that skeletal muscle works as an endocrine organ, which can produce and secrete hundreds of myokines that exert their effects in either autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manners. Recent advances show that skeletal muscle produces myokines in response to exercise, which allow for crosstalk between the muscle and other organs, including brain, adipose tissue, bone, liver, gut, pancreas, vascular bed, and skin, as well as communication within the muscle itself. Although only few myokines have been allocated to a specific function in humans, it has been identified that the biological roles of myokines include effects on, for example, cognition, lipid and glucose metabolism, browning of white fat, bone formation, endothelial cell function, hypertrophy, skin structure, and tumor growth. This suggests that myokines may be useful biomarkers for monitoring exercise prescription for people with, for example, cancer, diabetes, or neurodegenerative diseases. © Endocrine Society 2020},

  abstract = {The world’s population continues to increase, meaning we require more consistent protein supply to meet demand. Despite the availability of plant-based protein alternatives, animal meat remains a popular, high-quality protein source. Research studies have focused on cultured meat (meat grown in vitro) as a safe and more efficient alternative to traditional meat. Cultured meat is produced by in vitro myogenesis, which involves the processing of muscle satellite and mature muscle cells. Meat culture efficiency is largely determined by the culture conditions, such as the cell type and cell culture medium used and the biomolecular composition. Protein production can be enhanced by providing the optimum biochemical and physical conditions for skeletal muscle cell growth, while myoblasts play important roles in skeletal muscle formation and growth. This review describes the cell types used to produce cultured meat and the biological effects of various myokines and cytokines, such as interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-4, interleukin-15, and interleukin-1β, on skeletal muscle and myogenesis and their potential roles in cultured meat production. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between irisin level in umbilical cord blood and maternal serum with neonatal birthweight. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline were followed. A comprehensive search of eight databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CBM, CNKI, WANFANG and VIP) was performed from inception to November 2019. Studies with original date reporting irisin levels in newborns of small for gestational age (SGA) and newborns of large for gestational age (LGA) were included. Additionally, studies reporting correlation coefficients of irisin with birthweight were analyzed. Newcastle-Ottawa score system and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach were applied. Seventeen studies with 1866 participants were included. Pooled analysis indicated decreased cord irisin levels in SGA newborns (MD -10.57, 95 \% CI -13.41 to -7.73) and increased irisin levels in LGA newborns (MD 3.80, 95 \% CI 1.91–5.70). Umbilical cord irisin level was positively correlated with neonatal birthweight (r = 0.41 95 \%CI 0.04 to 0.68). The pooled correlation coefficient of maternal serum irisin with birthweight has no statistical significance. This meta-analysis suggested that the umbilical cord irisin levels were impaired in fetal growth abnormalities.

  abstract = {Physical activity, by definition, is any skeletal muscle body movement that results in energy expenditure. In the last few decades, a plethora of scientific evidences have accumulated and confirmed the beneficial role of physical activity as a modifiable risk factor for a wide variety of chronic diseases including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes mellitus and cancer, among others. Autoimmune diseases are a heterogeneous group of chronic diseases, which occur secondary to loss of self-antigen tolerance. With the advent of biological therapies, better outcomes have recently been noted in the management of autoimmune diseases. Nonetheless, recent research highlights the salient role of modifiable behaviors such as physical inactivity on various aspects of the immune system and autoimmune diseases. Physical activity leads to a significant elevation in T-regulatory cells, decreased immunoglobulin secretion and produces a shift in the Th1/Th2 balance to a decreased Th1 cell production. Moreover, physical activity has been proven to promote the release of IL-6 from muscles. IL-6 released from muscles functions as a myokine and has been shown to induce an anti-inflammatory response through IL-10 secretion and IL-1β inhibition. Physical activity has been shown to be safe in most of autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), as well as others. Additionally, the incidence of RA, MS, IBD and psoriasis has been found to be higher in patients less engaged in physical activity. As a general trend, patients with autoimmune diseases tend to be less physically active as compared to the general population. Physically active RA patients were found to have a milder disease course, better cardiovascular disease (CVD) profile, and improved joint mobility. Physical activity decreases fatigue, enhances mood, cognitive abilities and mobility in patients with MS. In SLE patients, enhanced quality of life and better CVD profile were documented in more physically active patients. Physically active patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus have a decreased risk of autonomic neuropathy and CVD. Both fibromyalgia and systemic sclerosis patients report decreased disease severity, pain, as well as better quality of life with more physical activity. Further, SSc patients improve their grip strength, finger stretching and mouth opening with increased level of exercise. The purpose of this paper is to review the clinical evidence regarding the safety, barriers to engagement, and impact of physical activity on autoimmune diseases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression examined the effect of acute normobaric hyperoxic breathing on cognition in healthy humans. 23 studies were included providing 76 effect estimates (EE). Hyperoxic breathing improved memory accuracy (22 EEs; g = 0.34) and speed (9 EEs; g = 0.59), attention ac­ curacy (7 EEs; g = 0.59) and speed (7 EEs; g = 0.51), reaction speed (8 EEs; g = 0.82), crystallised intelligence (7 EEs; g = 0.73), executive function (6 EEs; g = 0.88) and information processing (10 EEs; g = 0.62). However, the overall quality of evidence was low (average Rosendal score of 47\%) and there was a large range of study heterogeneity, with prediction intervals often crossing 0; therefore, reducing the reliability of the magnitude of these favourable effects. Oxygen percentage, 100\% compared with 22–99\% oxygen, temporal position of administration to task performance, and study quality did not influence the overall weighted mean effects for most cognitive domains. Altogether, despite beneficial results, further high quality research is required prior to recommending hyperoxic breathing to enhance cognition.},

  abstract = {Acute hypobaric hypoxia (HH) is a major physiological threat during high-altitude flight and operations. In military aviation, although hypoxia-related fatalities are rare, incidences are common and are likely underreported. Hypoxia is a reduction in oxygen availability, which can impair brain function and performance of operational and safety-critical tasks. HH occurs at high altitude, due to the reduction in atmospheric oxygen pressure. This physiological state is also partially simulated in normobaric environments for training and research, by reducing the fraction of inspired oxygen to achieve comparable tissue oxygen saturation [normobaric hypoxia (NH)]. Hypoxia can occur in susceptible individuals below 10,000 ft (3,048 m) in unpressurised aircrafts and at higher altitudes in pressurised environments when life support systems malfunction or due to improper equipment use. Between 10,000 ft and 15,000 ft (4,572 m), brain function is mildly impaired and hypoxic symptoms are common, although both are often difficult to accurately quantify, which may partly be due to the effects of hypocapnia. Above 15,000 ft, brain function exponentially deteriorates with increasing altitude until loss of consciousness. The period of effective and safe performance of operational tasks following exposure to hypoxia is termed the time-of-useful-consciousness (TUC). Recovery of brain function following hypoxia may also lag beyond arterial reoxygenation and could be exacerbated by repeated hypoxic exposures or hyperoxic recovery. This review provides an overview of the basic physiology and implications of hypoxia for military aviation and discusses the utility of hypoxia recognition training.},

  abstract = {Recovery of cognitive and physiological responses following a hypoxic exposure may not be considered in various operational and research settings. Understanding recovery profiles and influential factors can guide post-hypoxia restrictions to reduce the risk of further cognitive and physiological deterioration, and the potential for incidents and accidents. We systematically evaluated the available evidence on recovery of cognitive and basic physiological responses following an acute hypoxic exposure to improve understanding of the performance and safety implications, and to inform post-hypoxia restrictions. This systematic review summarises 30 studies that document the recovery of either a cognitive or physiological index from an acute hypoxic exposure. Titles and abstracts from PubMed (MEDLINE) and Scopus were searched from inception to July 2022, of which 22 full text articles were considered eligible. An additional 8 articles from other sources were identified and also considered eligible. The overall quality of evidence was moderate (average Rosendal score, 58\%) and there was a large range of hypoxic exposures. Heart rate, peripheral blood haemoglobin-oxygen saturation and heart rate variability typically normalised within seconds-to-minutes following return to normoxia or hyperoxia. Whereas, cognitive performance, blood pressure, cerebral tissue oxygenation, ventilation and electroencephalogram indices could persist for minutes-to-hours following a hypoxic exposure, and one study suggested regional cerebral tissue oxygenation requires up to 24 hours to recover. Full recovery of most cognitive and physiological indices, however, appear much sooner and typically within \textasciitilde 2–4 hours. Based on these findings, there is evidence to support a ‘hypoxia hangover’ and a need to implement restrictions following acute hypoxic exposures. The severity and duration of these restrictions is unclear but should consider the population, subsequent requirement for safety-critical tasks and hypoxic exposure.},

Some cytokines play a positive role in metabolism action, while others have a negative metabolic role linking to the induction of metabolic dysfunction. The mechanisms involved are not fully understood, but are associated with lipid accumulation in organs and tissues, especially in the adipose and liver tissue, changes in energy metabolism, and inflammatory signals derived from various cell types, including immune cells. In this review, we describe the roles of certain cytokines in the regulation of metabolism and inter-organ signaling in regard to the pathophysiological aspects. Given the disease-related changes in circulating levels of relevant cytokines, these factors may serve as biomarkers for the early detection of metabolic disorders. Moreover, based on preclinical studies, certain cytokines that can induce improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism and immune response may emerge as novel targets of broader and more efficacious treatments and prevention of metabolic disease. © Copyright © 2019 Shi, Fan, Su and Yang.},

Administration of exogenous βOHB, or fasting or calorie restriction, two conditions associated with increased βOHB abundance, all increased global histone acetylation in mouse tissues. Inhibition of HDAC by βOHB was correlated with global changes in transcription, including that of the genes encoding oxidative stress resistance factors FOXO3A and MT2. Treatment of cells with βOHB increased histone acetylation at the Foxo3a and Mt2 promoters, and both genes were activated by selective depletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2. Consistent with increased FOXO3A and MT2 activity, treatment of mice with βOHB conferred substantial protection against oxidative stress.},

High FIo2 is associated with absorption problems in the lungs, middle ear, and paranasal sinuses, particularly if FIo2 {$>$} 80\% and small airways, Eustachian tubes, or sinus passages are blocked. Absorption becomes faster as cabin altitude increases. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity and direct oxidative injuries, related to elevated Po2, are improbable in flight; no pulmonary oxygen toxicity has been found when Po2 {$<$} 55 kPa [418 Torr; 100\% O2 higher than 15,000 ft (4570 m)]. Symptoms with Po2 of 75 kPa [520 Torr; 100\% O2 at 10,000 ft (3050 m)] were reported after 24 h and the earliest signs at Po2 of 100 kPa (760 Torr, 100\% O2 at sea level) occurred after 6 h. However, treatment for decompression sickness entails a risk of pulmonary oxygen toxicity. Elevated Po2 also constricts blood vessels, changes blood pressure control, and reduces the response to low blood sugar. With healthy lungs, gas transport and oxygen delivery are not improved by increasing Po2. Near zero humidity of the breathing gas in which oxygen is delivered may predispose susceptible individuals to bronchoconstriction. Shykoff BE, Lee RL. Risks from breathing elevated oxygen.

  abstract = {Treatments for high altitude (mountain) illness         ,            Background         , Acute high altitude illness, also known as acute mountain sickness, may present with a variety of symptoms. It is caused by the decreasing level of oxygen at increasingly high altitudes; and it can be experienced when reaching a high altitude when travelling, hiking or climbing mountains or other elevated areas. People going to altitudes over 4000 metres, females, people younger than mid‐adulthood , and people with a history of migraine are at greater risk of suffering from altitude sickness. The most common symptoms are headache, loss of appetite , insomnia, and nausea. However, severe forms can include confusion, difficulty walking, progressive cough, shortness of breath, and even death.,            Review question         , What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people suffering from high altitude illness?,            Study characteristics         , We included 13 studies with a total of 468 participants. Most studies included participants with mild or moderate forms of mountain sickness, and only one study included the severe neurological (disorder of the nervous system) form. Follow‐up was usually less than one day. We also identified two ongoing studies.,            Key results         , We found studies evaluating the following interventions: simulated descent with a hyperbaric chamber (medical use of oxygen in a special chamber at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body); oxygen; medicines: acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulphate. None of the studies reported the effects of these interventions on all‐cause mortality. The report of complete relief from acute mountain sickness symptoms, and adverse events was infrequent. Studies related to simulated descent with the use of a hyperbaric chamber did not find additional benefits or harms related to this intervention (3 studies, 124 participants). In addition, studies related to administration of medicines found some benefits in terms of reduction of symptoms with the use of acetazolamide (2 studies, 25 participants), and dexamethasone (1 study, 35 participants), without an increase in side effects.,            Quality of the evidence         , The quality of the evidence we found was low, and thus our certainty in the findings is limited. There was insufficient information on how the studies were conducted, and in some cases there was evidence of tampering at some stages of the trials. Furthermore, the number of persons in each study was very small ({$<$} 30 participants), and therefore the results were not clear (imprecise). Some studies were not blinded (that is, participants knew what experimental treatment they were receiving), and this could have affected how the participants evaluated their own symptoms.},

  abstract = {Bone renews itself and changes shape throughout life to account for the changing needs of the body; this requires co-ordinated activities of bone resorbing cells (osteoclasts), bone forming cells (osteoblasts) and bone's internal cellular network (osteocytes). This review focuses on paracrine signaling by the IL-6 family of cytokines between bone cells, bone marrow, and skeletal muscle in normal physiology and in pathological states where their levels may be locally or systemically elevated. These functions include the support of osteoclast formation by osteoblast lineage cells in response to interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 11 (IL-11), oncostatin M (OSM) and cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1). In addition it will discuss how bone-resorbing osteoclasts promote osteoblast activity by secreting CT-1, which acts as a “coupling factor” on osteocytes, osteoblasts, and their precursors to promote bone formation. OSM, produced by osteoblast lineage cells and macrophages, stimulates bone formation via osteocytes. IL-6 family cytokines also mediate actions of other bone formation stimuli like parathyroid hormone (PTH) and mechanical loading. CT-1, OSM and LIF suppress marrow adipogenesis by shifting commitment of pluripotent precursors towards osteoblast differentiation. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is released as a myokine from skeletal muscle and suppresses osteoblast differentiation and bone formation on the periosteum (outer bone surface in apposition to muscle). Finally, IL-6 acts directly on marrow-derived osteoclasts to stimulate release of “osteotransmitters” that act through the cortical osteocyte network to stimulate bone formation on the periosteum. Each will be discussed as illustrations of how the extended family of IL-6 cytokines acts within the skeleton in physiology and may be altered in pathological conditions or by targeted therapies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Exercise is accompanied by an increased plasma concentration of α-calcitonin gene-related peptide (αCGRP), a 37-amino acid peptide with vasodilatory effects and causative roles in migraine. Moreover, mouse models revealed that loss of αCGRP disrupts physiological adaptation of the cardiovascular system to exercise in normotension and aggravates cardiovascular impairment in primary chronic hypertension, both can be reversed by αCGRP administration. This suggests that αCGRP agonists could be a therapeutic option to mediate the cardiovascular protective effects of exercise in clinical setting where exercise is not possible or contraindicated. Of note, FDA has recently approved αCGRP antagonists for migraine prophylaxis therapy, however, the cardiovascular safety of long-term anti-CGRP therapy in individuals with cardiovascular diseases has yet to be established. Current evidence from preclinical models suggests that chronic αCGRP antagonism may abolish the cardiovascular protective effects of exercise in both normotension and chronic hypertension.

  abstract = {Irisin is an exercise induced myokine first shown to induce the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) which increases energy expenditure, improves glucose tolerance, and reduces insulin resistance. Among irisin's involvement in lipid homeostasis, osteoblast proliferation, and muscle growth, it also acts as a mediator of many inflammatory pathways throughout the body. This review aims to describe the role of irisin in inflammatory processes and understand how targeting irisin can alter the inflammatory response in metabolic syndrome (MetS). The mechanisms involved in irisin's anti-inflammatory functions include reducing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, reducing macrophage proliferation, inducing alternatively activated (M2-type) macrophage polarization, inhibiting pathways of increased vascular permeability, and preventing the formation of inflammasomes. While there are some contradictory results, most studies found reduced levels of irisin in MetS and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Irisin treatment of cells exposed to inflammatory stimuli ameliorates the inflammatory response and promotes cellular viability. Numerous methods have been studied to increase plasma irisin levels including dietary, behavioral, and pharmaceutical. Further investigation is necessary to understand how irisin can be targeted for disease modification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.}

To record the level of EI, we used TEIQue-SF/TEIQue-ASF (Slovak translation by: Kaliska, Nabelkova and Salbot, 2015) and to determine the share of individual personality dimensions on a global level of achievement motivation, we used LMI (translation and editing by: Hoskovcová, 2003). From mathematical-statistical methods, we subjected the data to correlation and regression analysis. Results: We found the closest significant correlations in the case of well-being and confidence in success, flexibility, which is also significantly associated with self-control. Sociability is most strongly associated with dominance and emotionality with flexibility and internality. The global level of trait EI is most significantly associated with confidence in success and flexibility. Discussion: Our findings clearly show that adequate processing of one's own emotions contributes to a deepening of concentration on sport achievement as well as to a higher self-confidence reflected in the setting of more adequate and realistic goals.},

  abstract = {Two studies examined the effects of PETTLEP-based imagery compared to more traditional imagery interventions. PETTLEP imagery aims to produce a realistic and more functionally equivalent imagery experience than traditional imagery methods through factors such as wearing the correct clothing or imaging in the correct environment. In Study 1, 48 varsity hockey players were divided into four groups: "Sport-specific" imagery, "clothing" imagery, "traditional" imagery, and control. Imagery participants imaged 10 penalty flicks daily for six weeks, and controls spent an equivalent time reading hockey literature. In the post-test, the sport-specific group scored significantly higher than the clothing group, who scored significantly higher than the traditional imagery group. In Study 2, 40 junior gymnasts attempted a turning jump on the beam. They were split into four groups: A physical practice group, a PETTLEP imagery group, a stimulus only imagery group, and a control (stretching) group. Each group performed their task three times per week for six weeks. Both the physical practice and PETTLEP groups improved significantly from pre-test to post-test, with no significant difference between them, but the stimulus and control groups did not improve significantly. Taken together the results from Study 1 and 2 provide support for the efficacy of PETTLEP-based imagery over more traditional imagery interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

  abstract = {Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that bind DNA and translate physiological signals into gene regulation. The therapeutic utility of NRs is underscored by the diversity of drugs created to manage dysfunctional hormone signaling in the context of reproductive biology, inflammation, dermatology, cancer, and metabolic disease. For example, drugs that target nuclear receptors generate over \$10 billion in annual sales. Almost two decades ago, gene products were identified that belonged to the NR superfamily on the basis of DNA and protein sequence identity. However, the endogenous and synthetic small molecules that modulate their action were not known, and they were denoted orphan NRs. Many of the remaining orphan NRs are highly enriched in energy-demanding major mass tissues, including skeletal muscle, brown and white adipose, brain, liver, and kidney. This review focuses on recently adopted and orphan NR function in skeletal muscle, a tissue that accounts for ∼35\% of the total body mass and energy expenditure, and is a major site of fatty acid and glucose utilization. Moreover, this lean tissue is involved in cholesterol efflux and secretes that control energy expenditure and adiposity. Consequently, muscle has a significant role in insulin sensitivity, the blood lipid profile, and energy balance. Accordingly, skeletal muscle plays a considerable role in the progression of dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity. These are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, which is the the foremost cause of global mortality ({$>$}16.7 million deaths in 2003). Therefore, it is not surprising that orphan NRs and skeletal muscle are emerging as therapeutic candidates in the battle against dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.

  abstract = {Berthold's classic study of domesticated roosters in 1849 demonstrated that testicular secretions are necessary for the normal expression of aggressive behaviour. Although this conclusion is undoubtedly correct, field studies of wild songbirds have yielded important modifications and limitations of Berthold's original hypothesis. For example, studies of the North American song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) during the breeding season reveal that not only does testosterone increase aggression, but aggressive interactions also increase plasma testosterone levels. Furthermore, in winter, nonbreeding song sparrows have low plasma testosterone levels but are very aggressive, and castration of nonbreeding song sparrows does not decrease aggression. Interestingly, an aromatase inhibitor (fadrozole) does decrease male aggression in the nonbreeding season, and the effects of fadrozole can be rescued with oestradiol. In winter, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) from the periphery can be metabolised within the brain to supply oestradiol to specific neural circuits. Additionally, oestradiol might be synthesised de novo from cholesterol entirely within the brain. These mechanisms may have evolved to avoid the 'costs' of circulating testosterone in the nonbreeding season. Recent studies in tropical birds, hamsters, and humans suggest that these neuroendocrine mechanisms are important for the control of aggression in many vertebrate species.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Myokines, known to mediate metabolism, inflammation, and other pathophysiological conditions, have been widely investigated, including myokines induced by exercise. However, among published literature, there is substantial inconsistency in the quantification of exercise-induced myokines. Here, we summarized and compared published data regarding the effects of exercise on commonly studied myokines including apelin, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Interleukin-15 (IL-15), irisin, and Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) during the last decade and discussed possible reasons for discrepancy in these reports. Areas covered: A search on PubMed for original articles published in this decade was conducted, focusing on the impacts of exercises on myokines and metabolic and age-related disorders. Beneficial relationship between skeletal muscle plasticity and myokines due to exercise is also discussed. Expert commentary: Based on these analyses, exercise induces the secretion of a number of myokines, which has positive effects on metabolic diseases or age-related muscle atrophy (sarcopenia). However, among published reports, there is wide discrepancy in the quantification of myokines induced by exercise, which could be due to timing of sample collection, pre-analytic sample processing, analytical method, and calculation and other factors. Thus, these factors need to be considered in future studies on exercise induced myokines. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Secretory proteins play important roles in the cross-talk of individual functional units, including cells. Since secretory proteins are essential for signal transduction, they are closely related with disease development, including metabolic and neural diseases. In metabolic diseases, adipokines, myokines, and hepatokines are secreted from respective organs under specific environmental conditions, and play roles in glucose homeostasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. In neural diseases, astrocytes and microglia cells secrete cytokines and chemokines that play roles in neurotoxic and neuroprotective responses. Mass spectrometry-based secretome profiling is a powerful strategy to identify and characterize secretory proteins. This strategy involves stepwise processes such as the collection of conditioned medium (CM) containing secretome proteins and concentration of the CM, peptide preparation, mass analysis, database search, and filtering of secretory proteins; each step requires certain conditions to obtain reliable results. Proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles has become a new research focus for understanding the additional extracellular functions of intracellular proteins. Here, we provide a review of the insights obtained from secretome analyses with regard to disease mechanisms, and highlight the future prospects of this technology. Continued research in this field is expected to provide valuable information on cell-to-cell communication and uncover new pathological mechanisms. © 2019 by the authors.

PRMTs appear to be critical regulators in skeletal muscle physiology, including regeneration, metabolic homeostasis, and plasticity. Chronic inflammation is commonly associated with the decline of skeletal muscle mass and strength related to aging or chronic diseases, defined as sarcopenia. In turn, declined skeletal muscle mass and strength can exacerbate chronic inflammation. Thus, understanding the molecular regulatory pathway underlying the crosstalk between skeletal muscle function and inflammation might be essential for the intervention of muscle pathophysiology. In this review, we will address the current knowledge on the role of PRMTs in skeletal muscle physiology and pathophysiology with a specific emphasis on its relationship with inflammation. © Copyright © 2021 So, Kim, Kang and Lee.},

However, healthcare practices have been viewed primarily as an example of complex cultural behaviour, often discussed alongside symbolism or mortuary practices. Here we argue that care for the ill and injured is likely to have a long evolutionary history and to have been highly effective in improving health and reducing mortality risks. Healthcare provisioning can thus be understood alongside other collaborative ‘risk pooling’ strategies such as collaborative hunting, food sharing and collaborative parenting. For Neanderthals in particular the selective advantages of healthcare provisioning would have been elevated by a variety of ecological conditions which increased the risk of injury as well their particular behavioural adaptations which affected the benefits of promoting survival from injury and illness. We argue that healthcare provisioning was not only a more significant evolutionary adaptation than has previously been acknowledged, but moreover may also have been essential to Neanderthal occupation at the limits of the North Temperate Zone. @@@@Highlights •In the Neanderthal ecological niche mortality risks from injuries were typically high.•Neanderthal record of care practices is biased towards severe cases.•Healthcare appears to have been generally low cost and effective in reducing mortality.},

  abstract = {The liver is known to be involved in the natural history of the ongoing epidemics of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. In particular, the liver has a role in increased glucose production and dysregulated lipoprotein metabolism, conditions that are often found in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Additionally, several proteins that are exclusively or predominantly secreted from the liver are now known to directly affect glucose and lipid metabolism. In analogy to the functional proteins released from adipose tissue and skeletal muscle - adipokines and myokines - these liver-derived proteins are known as hepatokines. The first hepatokine that has been proven to have a major pathogenetic role in metabolic diseases is α2-HS-glycoprotein (fetuin-A). Production of this glycoprotein is increased in steatotic and inflamed liver, but not in expanded and dysregulated adipose tissue. Thus, research into this molecule and other hepatokines is expected to aid in differentiating between the contribution of liver and those of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Purpose of review: High-fat diets lead to obesity and increase the risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle act as endocrine organs, and produce various cytokines that can potentially alter peripheral insulin sensitivity. The purpose of the present review is to briefly summarize the effects of major cytokines (leptin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6) on muscle metabolism and insulin response, with a focus on the effects of diet and exercise. Recent findings: Leptin and adiponectin improve insulin sensitivity. However, in obesity there is a diminished response to these adipokines. This resistance can be induced very rapidly and may lead to subsequent impairments in insulin response. Tumor necrosis factor-α is a proinflammatory cytokine that has been implicated as a mediator of insulin resistance, particularly in obesity. Interleukin-6 was the first identified myokine. There is evidence to implicate interleukin-6 both as a mediator of impaired insulin action in obesity, and also as a facilitator of increased fuel metabolism during exercise. The effect of each of these cytokines on muscle insulin sensitivity can be modulated by diet and exercise. Summary: Much of the information summarized in the present review focuses on the effects of various cytokines in isolation, although in vivo there can be considerable interaction with each other. Future research should consider these potential interactions. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

  abstract = {Increasing life expectancy has resulted in a growing number of individuals living with chronic, age-related conditions. This challenges healthcare systems worldwide and results in loss of quality of life in individuals living with chronic conditions. Strategies to promote healthy aging are thus gaining attention. Lifestyle factors such as caloric restriction, carbohydrate restriction and physical activity specifically modify a number of biological pathways associated with aging. One central shared mechanism seems to be the upregulating of maintenance pathways such as the AMPK signaling pathway, triggered by a low cellular energy status, as well as downregulation of anabolic pathways such as the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. The transient energy deficit evoked by (intermittent) caloric restriction or vigorous physical activity – or the phenotypic imitation of this physiological state by dietary carbohydrate restriction – might offer some biologic plausibility for the observation of the benefits of these lifestyle factors. Largely independent of these mechanisms, physical activity directly impacts on downstream adaptive cellular responses via muscle-tissue crosstalk through myokines, i.e. hormone-like substances secreted by skeletal muscle in response to exercise. It is worth noting that distinct pharmaceuticals such as metformin, SGLT2-inhibitors and statins have the potential to complement lifestyle factors by directly modifying these longevity-associated pathways. Lifestyle factors are relevant determinants of health-and potentially of lifespan. Recent findings have significantly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms involved. This narrative review provides a perspective on selected modifiable determinants of healthspan and furthermore elucidates therapeutic avenues that have the potential to attenuate premature aging and to refine personalized preventive care. © 2021, Dynamic Media Sales Verlag.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Warm-up routines typically include low-intensity aerobic activities, stretching and sport-specific movement patterns rehearsal. Different types of stretching may be included, with static stretching (SS) and dynamic stretching being main 2 types, with persistent debate as to the most appropriate type of stretching to perform. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of static and dynamic stretching on vertical jump performance. METHODS: Twenty-three youth basketball players (age, 15.33±0.77 years; height, 182.64±13.18 cm; body mass, 71.01±18.74 kg; training experience, 5.91±1.92 years), participated in this randomized crossover study. After one familiarization session, two test sessions with different warm up protocols were performed in a random order with one week between sessions. Each session consisted of a) 5-minute low-intensity aerobic exercises and b) 8 minutes of static/dynamic stretching, interspersed and immediately followed by countermovement jump testing. The effects of different stretching protocols on countermovement jump height were determined using a 2 (time: pre, post) x 2 (pre-jump protocol: dynamic versus static stretching) repeated analysis of variance. RESULTS: Countermovement jump height was influenced by the interaction of time/ pre-jump stretching protocol (P=0.003), with SS significantly decreasing jumping performance (2.36±2.19 cm; P=0.001 CI: 1.41-3.30 cm). Dynamic stretching appears to provide non-significant improvements (0.46±1.60 cm; P=0.180; CI: 1.15-0.22 cm). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that static stretching before practice or competition should be avoided in adolescent basketball players.},

  abstract = {Anorexia nervosa is a syndrome, that is collections of symptoms, which is not defined by its etiology. The severe cases are intractable. The syndrome is associated with multiple, profound endocrine alterations which may be adaptive, reactive or etiologic. Adaptive changes potentially may be inappropriate in clinical settings such as inpatient intensive re-nutrition or in a setting with somatic comorbidity. Electrolyte levels must be closely monitored during the refeeding process, and the need for weight gain must be balanced against potentially fatal refeeding complications. An important focus of clinical research should be to identify biomarkers associated with different stages of weight loss and re-nutrition combined with psychometric data. Besides well-established peripheral endocrine actions, several hormones also are released directly to different brain areas, where they may exert behavioral and psychogenic actions that could offer therapeutic targets. We need reliable biomarkers for predicting outcome and to ensure safe re-nutrition, however, first of all we need them to explore the metabolism in anorexia nervosa to open new avenues with therapeutic targets. A breakthrough in our understanding and treatment of this whimsical disease remains. Considering this, the aim of the present review is to provide an updated overview of the many endocrine changes in a clinical perspective. © 2019 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE: The relative age effect (RAE) has been described as the consequence of differences in ages between individuals within the same age group. In youth sports, relatively older children may have a physical and developmental advantage over younger children. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between relative age and sports injury in a cohort of pediatric athletes. METHODS: A probability sample (n = 1997) of children between 5 and 17 yr of age with sports injuries were extracted from a regional hospital database. Relative age was defined as a child's birth month relative to the month that his/her activity uses as an arbitrary age cutoff. The main outcome measure was an activity-specific birth month ratio, which was developed and compared with birth month data for the state. Linear regression models were used to determine overrepresentation and underrepresentation of sports injuries for prepubescent (5-13 yr) and pubescent (14-17 yr) groups separately. RESULTS: Among prepubescent patients, the linear regression model indicated a significant RAE on sports injury (R = 0.037), where those born in or right after the cutoff month for their sports were underrepresented in the study cohort relative to their representation in the general population. For the pubescent group, the RAE was reversed, where those born closest, but before the age cutoff date for their sports were the least represented relative to the general population (R = 0.096). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate an RAE on youth sports injury risk in a cohort of pediatric athletes with sports-related injuries. These findings may be used to inform safe practices within sports participation among youth athletes.},

  abstract = {Background: A sufficient supply of oxygen is crucial to avoid hypoxic cardiac arrest and brain damage within 30 min in completely-buried avalanche victims. Snow density influences levels of hypoxia and hypercapnia. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of hypoxia and hypercapnia on cerebral oxygenation (ScO2) in humans breathing into an artificial air pocket. Methods: Each subject breathed into a closed system (air-tight face mask À plastic tube À snow air-pocket of 4 L) up to 30 min. Each subject performed three tests in different snow densities. ScO2 was measured by a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device. Measurements included peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), air pocket gases and blood gases. Snow density was assessed via standard methods and microcomputed tomography. Based on predetermined criteria, tests were classified based on whether they were terminated before 30 min and the reason for termination. The categories were: completed tests (30 min), tests terminated before 30 min when SpO2 dropped to 75\% and tests that were terminated before 30 min by requests of the subjects. General linear models were used to compare termination groups for changes in ScO2, ETCO2, SpO2 and air pocket gases, and a multivariate analysis was used to detect factor independent effects on ScO2. Results: ScO2 was decreased in the group in which the tests were terminated for SpO2 75\% caused by a decrease in oxygen supply in high snow densities. In the completed tests, an increase in ScO2 occurred despite decreased oxygen supply and decreased carbon dioxide removal. Conclusions: Our data show that ScO2 determined by NIRS was not always impaired in humans breathing into an artificial air pocket despite decreased oxygen supply and decreased carbon dioxide removal. This may indicate that in medium to low snow densities brain oxygenation can be sufficient, which may reflect the initial stage of the triple H (hypothermia, hypoxia, and hypercapnia) syndrome. In high snow densities, ScO2 showed a significant decrease caused by a critical decrease in oxygen supply. This could lead to a higher risk of hypoxic cardiac arrest and brain damage.},

The sample consisted of 249 youth basketball players ranging in age from 9 to 15 years. A questionnaire was administered to the players during a team practice session near the end of a 10-week competitive season. Perceptions of significant other (mother, father, coach, teammates) approval of antisocial behavior served as the predictor variables; moral development components (judgment, reason, intent, behavior) served as the criterion variables. Canonical correlation analyses revealed significant overall relationships for both younger children (Grades 4 and 5) and adolescents (Grades 7 and 8). For younger children, lower perceptions of social approval were associated with a higher ability to judge a situation as a moral problem and the intent to exhibit moral behavior. For adolescents, perceived social approval was inversely related to reason, prosocial behavior, and particularly the judgment of a moral problem and the intent to exhibit moral behavior. These findings are discussed in terms of the importance of continuing to understand the influence of significant others on moral development in youth sport [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Pediatric Exercise Science is the property of Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

However, the general public's rest and activity expectations for this injury are unknown, as are the individual factors that might affect them. 165 individuals completed an online survey. A series of between-groups comparisons of expectations for the week following a mild TBI was performed. The comparisons were between individuals with or without a prior mild TBI; sports-playing versus non-sports-playing individuals, and; females versus males. Expectations were elicited for 39 everyday behaviours referred to in mild TBI patient advice. Compared to a rating indicating 'no change' in the amount of pre-injury activity, "rest" was expected for 37 items (p's {$<$} .05). Expectations were not different based on participants' sex or sports-participation. However, for seven predominantly cognitive items such as studying, a prior injury increased rest expectations (p {$<$} .05; small-to-medium effects). The findings indicate that whilst the proposed activity restrictions are appropriate for some circumstances such as acutely postinjury, they have the potential to be overly strong. To address this potential, especially with first-ever injury, clinicians and sports officials should check their patient's postinjury rest and activity plans when providing active rest advice.},

Design: Methodological study. Setting: A health promotion research institute. subjects: In study A, volunteers (n = 42) from two worksites participated. In study B, a population sample (n = 510) of 37- to 57-year-old men and women was selected. Main Outcome Measures: Intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated measures was used to assess inter-rater reliability. The degree of measurement error was expressed as the standard error of measurement. The mean difference with 95\% confidence intervals between the testing days or test trials was used to assess test-retest or trial-to-trial reproducibility. The coefficient of variation (CV = [SD/mean] × 100\%) from day to day was also calculated. Results: The following tests appeared to provide acceptable reliability as methods for field assessment of HRF: standing on one leg with eyes open for balance, side-bending of the trunk for spinal flexibility, modified push-ups for upper body muscular function, and jump and reach and one leg squat for leg muscular function. Conclusions: This reliability assessment provided useful information on the characteristics of potential test items in a HRF test battery for adults and on the limitations of its practical use. Testers must be properly trained to ensure reliable assessment of HRF of adults.},

Health-related fitness refers to those components of fitness that are related to health status. The safety and feasibility of a test battery designed for the assessment of HRFI were evaluated. Subjects and Methods. Middle-aged men (n=246) and women (n=254), evenly selected from five age cohorts of a random sample (N=826), were tested. The subjects had a mean age of 47.0 years (SD=7.9, range=37–57). Screening to identify subjects with health limitations was conducted by fitness testers who had master's degrees in sport or health sciences. Safety was assessed in terms of acute complications, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and heart rate after each test. Subject exclusion and time costs were evaluated for feasibility. Results. No acute complications occurred. The leg function test caused severe DOMS among inactive women. The overall exclusion rate increased with age. Up to 27\% of subjects aged 52 and 57 years were excluded from muscle endurance tests, mainly due to self-reported heart disease or elevated blood pressures. Over 90\% of the subjects, however, qualified for balance, flexibility, muscle force, and walk tests. Conclusion and Discussion. The test battery offers a safe and feasible method for the assessment of HRFI in working-aged adults, with the limitation that the one-leg squat function test may cause DOMS, particularly in inactive women.},

  abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an atypical member of the FGF family, which functions as a powerful endocrine and paracrine regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. In addition to liver and adipose tissue, recent studies have shown that FGF21 can also be produced in skeletal muscle. As the most abundant tissue in the human body, skeletal muscle has become increasingly recognized as a major site of metabolic activity and an important modulator of systemic metabolic homeostasis. The function and mechanism of action of muscle-derived FGF21 have recently gained attention due to the findings of considerably increased expression and secretion of FGF21 from skeletal muscle under certain pathological conditions. Recent reports regarding the ectopic expression of FGF21 from skeletal muscle and its potential effects on the musculoskeletal system unfolds a new chapter in the story of FGF21. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge base of muscle-derived FGF21 and the possible functions of FGF21 on homeostasis of the musculoskeletal system with a focus on skeletal muscle and bone. © Copyright © 2021 Sun, Sherrier and Li.},

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are important public health problems. The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus is 8.8\%. Interventional diabetology and obesitology have been recently advocated as treatment options for T2D and obesity. The roles of metabolic surgery such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, gastric banding, and biliopancreatic diversion are focused. Different types of metabolic surgeries have different glucose-lowering and weight loss effects. Endoscopic treatments include the intra-gastric balloon (to restrict the gastric volume) and duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL, as a malabsorptive procedure). Anatomic changes in the gastrointestinal tract may cause alterations in gut hormones, bile acids, adipokines, inflammatory cytokines, hepatokines, myokines, gut microbiota, and even unidentified factors. Modulating gut hormones, including foregut (ghrelin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and hindgut (glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY) hormones, through metabolic surgeries improves glycemic homeostasis. Metabolic surgeries reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines. Metabolic surgeries also regulate one's appetite through the new establishment of jejunal nutrient sensing. Therefore, the effects of metabolic surgery and DJBL implantation emphasize the crucial role of the small intestine in glucose homeostasis. Removing diabetogenic or obesogenic factors from the duodenum and/or jejunum may help to solve the problems of diabetes and obesity in the future. © 2017 The Authors},

  abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence showing the importance of physical activity against acute ischemic events in various organs. Ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) is characterized by tissue damage as a result of restriction and subsequent restoration of blood supply to an organ. Oxidative stress due to increased reactive oxygen species formation and/or insufficient antioxidant defense is considered to play an important role in I/R. Physical activity not only decreases the general risk factors for ischemia but also confers direct anti-ischemic protection via myokine production. Myokines are skeletal muscle-derived cytokines, representing multifunctional communication channels between the contracting skeletal muscle and other organs through an endocrine manner. In this review, we discuss the most prominent members of the myokines (i.e., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cathepsin B, decorin, fibroblast growth factors-2 and-21, follistatin, follistatin-like, insulin-like growth factor-1; interleukin-6, interleukin-7, interleukin-15, irisin, leukemia inhibitory factor, meteorin-like, myonectin, musclin, myostatin, and osteoglycin) with a particular interest in their potential influence on reactive oxygen and nitrogen species formation or antioxidant capacity. A better understanding of the mechanism of action of myokines and particularly their participation in the regulation of oxidative stress may widen their possible therapeutic use and, thereby, may support the fight against I/R. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract = {As bones are levers for skeletal muscle to exert forces, both are complementary and essential for locomotion and individual autonomy. In the past decades, the idea of a bone-muscle unit has emerged. Numerous studies have confirmed this hypothesis from in utero to aging works. Space flight, bed rest as well as osteoporosis and sarcopenia experimentations have allowed to accumulate considerable evidence. Mechanical loading is a key mechanism linking both tissues with a central promoting role of physical activity. Moreover, the skeletal muscle secretome accounts various molecules that affect bone including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-15, myostatin, osteoglycin (OGN), FAM5C, Tmem119 and osteoactivin. Even though studies on the potential effects of bone on muscle metabolism are sparse, few osteokines have been identified. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and Wnt3a, which are secreted by osteocytes, osteocalcin (OCN) and IGF-1, which are produced by osteoblasts and sclerostin which is secreted by both cell types, might impact skeletal muscle cells. Cartilage and adipose tissue are also likely to participate to this control loop and should not be set aside. Indeed, chondrocytes are known to secrete Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) and Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and adipocytes produce leptin, adiponectin and IL-6, which potentially modulate bone and muscle metabolisms. The understanding of this system will enable to define new levers to prevent/treat sarcopenia and osteoporosis at the same time. These strategies might include nutritional interventions and physical exercise. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Chronic diseases, including heart failure (HF), are often accompanied with skeletal muscle abnormalities in both quality and quantity, which are the major cause of impairment of the activities of daily living and quality of life. We have shown that skeletal muscle abnormalities are a hallmark of HF, in which metabolic pathways involving phosphocreatine and fatty acids are largely affected. Not only in HF, but the dysfunction of fatty acid metabolism may also occur in many chronic diseases, such as arteriosclerosis, as well as through insufficient physical exercise. Decreased fatty acid catabolism affects adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in mitochondria, via decreased activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle; and may cause abnormal accumulation of adipose tissue accompanied with hyperoxidation and ectopic lipid deposition. Such impairments of lipid metabolism are in turn detrimental to skeletal muscle, which is hence a chicken-and-egg problem between skeletal muscle and HF. In this review, we first discuss skeletal muscle abnormalities in HF, including sarcopenia; particularly their association with lipid metabolism and adipose tissue. On the other hand, the precise mechanisms involved in metabolic reprogramming and dysfunction are beginning to be understood, and an imbalance of daily nutritional intake of individuals has been found to be a causative factor for the development and worsening of HF. Physical exercise has long been known to be beneficial for the prevention and even treatment of HF. Again, the molecular mechanisms by which exercise promotes skeletal muscle as well as cardiac muscle functions are being clarified by recent studies. We propose that it is now the time to develop more “natural” methods to prevent and treat HF, rather than merely relying on drugs and medical interventions. Further analysis of the basic design of and molecular mechanisms involved in the human body, particularly the inextricable association between physical exercise and the integrity and functional plasticity of skeletal and cardiac muscles is required. © Copyright © 2020 Takada, Sabe and Kinugawa.},

  abstract = {The prevalence and incidence of metabolic syndrome is reaching pandemic proportions worldwide, thus warranting an intensive search for novel preventive and treatment strategies. Recent studies have identified a number of soluble factors secreted by adipocytes and myocytes (adipo-/myokines), which link sedentary life style, abdominal obesity, and impairments in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In this review, we discuss the metabolic roles of the recently discovered myokine β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA), which is produced by skeletal muscle during physical activity. In addition to physical activity, the circulating levels of BAIBA are controlled by the mitochondrial enzyme alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2), which is primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys. Recent studies have shown that BAIBA can protect from diet-induced obesity in animal models. It induces transition of white adipose tissue to a “beige” phenotype, which induces fatty acids oxidation and increases insulin sensitivity. While the exact mechanisms of BAIBA-induced metabolic effects are still not well understood, we discuss some of the proposed pathways. The reviewed data provide new insights into the connection between physical activity and energy metabolism and suggest that BAIBA might be a potential novel drug for treatment of the metabolic syndrome and its cardiovascular complications. © 2019 by the authors.

  abstract = {Background: Recurrently disrupted sleep is a widespread phenomenon in our society. This is worrisome as chronically impaired sleep increases the risk of numerous diseases that place a heavy burden on health services worldwide, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, depression, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. Therefore, strategies mitigating the current societal sleep crisis are needed. Scope of review: Observational and interventional studies have found that regular moderate to intensive exercise is associated with better subjective and objective sleep in humans, with and without pre-existing sleep disturbances. Here, we summarize recent findings from clinical studies in humans and animal experiments suggesting that molecules that are expressed, produced, and released by the skeletal muscle in response to exercise may contribute to the sleep-improving effects of exercise. Major conclusions: Exercise-induced skeletal muscle recruitment increases blood concentrations of signaling molecules, such as the myokine brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which has been shown to increase the depth of sleep in animals. As reviewed herein, BDNF and other muscle-induced factors are likely to contribute to the sleep-promoting effects of exercise. Despite progress in the field, however, several fundamental questions remain. For example, one central question concerns the optimal time window for exercise to promote sleep. It is also unknown whether the production of muscle-induced peripheral factors promoting sleep is altered by acute and chronic sleep disturbances, which has become increasingly common in the modern 24/7 lifestyle. © 2020 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {There is substantial evidence that static stretching may inhibit performance in strength and power activities. However, most of this research has involved stretching routines dissimilar to those practiced by athletes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the decline in performance normally associated with static stretching pervades when the static stretching is conducted prior to a sport specific warm-up. Thirteen netball players completed two experimental warm-up conditions. Day 1 warm-up involved a submaximal run followed by 15 min of static stretching and a netball specific skill warm-up. Day 2 followed the same design; however, the static stretching was replaced with a 15 min dynamic warm-up routine to allow for a direct comparison between the static stretching and dynamic warm-up effects. Participants performed a countermovement vertical jump and 20 m sprint after the first warm-up intervention (static or dynamic) and also after the netball specific skill warm-up. The static stretching condition resulted in significantly worse performance than the dynamic warm-up in vertical jump height (−4.2\%, 0.40 ES) and 20 m sprint time (1.4\%, 0.34 ES) (p {$<$} 0.05). However, no significant differences in either performance variable were evident when the skill-based warm-up was preceded by static stretching or a dynamic warm-up routine. This suggests that the practice of a subsequent high-intensity skill based warm-up restored the differences between the two warm-up interventions. Hence, if static stretching is to be included in the warm-up period, it is recommended that a period of high-intensity sport-specific skills based activity is included prior to the on-court/field performance.},

  abstract = {Evidence is strong that a reduction in risk for breast cancer is associated with moderate to vigorous physical activity (PA); however, there is limited understanding of the role of type, intensity, duration, and frequency of PA and their mechanisms in accounting for this health benefit. The objective of this review is to stimulate investigations of candidate mechanisms that may account for the effects of the intensity and duration of aerobic PA on breast cancer risk and tumor burden. Three hypotheses are considered: 1) the mTOR network hypothesis: PA inhibits carcinogenesis by suppressing the activation of the mTOR signaling network in mammary carcinomas; 2) the hormesis hypothesis: the carcinogenic response to PA is nonlinear and accounted for by a physiological cellular stress response; and 3) the metabolic reprogramming hypothesis: PA limits the amount of glucose and glutamine available to mammary carcinomas thereby inducing apoptosis because tumor-associated metabolic programming is reversed. To link these hypotheses to systemic effects of PA, it is recommended that consideration be given to determining: 1) what contracting muscle releases into circulation or removes from circulation that would directly modulate the carcinogenic process in epithelial cells; 2) whether the effects of muscle contraction on epithelial cell carcinogenesis are exerted in an endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, or intracrine manner; and 3) if the effects of muscle contraction on malignant cells differ from effects on normal or premalignant cells that do not manifest the hallmarks of malignancy. © 2009 IUBMB.},

  abstract = {Aging is associated with both muscle weakness and a loss of muscle mass, contributing towards overall frailty in the elderly. Aging skeletal muscle is also characterised by a decreasing efficiency in repair and regeneration, together with a decline in the number of adult stem cells. Commensurate with this are general changes in whole body endocrine signalling, in local muscle secretory environment, as well as in intrinsic properties of the stem cells themselves. The present review discusses the various mechanisms that may be implicated in these age-Associated changes, focusing on aspects of cell-cell communication and long-distance signalling factors, such as levels of circulating growth hormone, IL-6, IGF1, sex hormones, and inflammatory cytokines. Changes in the local environment are also discussed, implicating IL-6, IL-4, FGF-2, as well as other myokines, and processes that lead to thickening of the extra-cellular matrix. These factors, involved primarily in communication, can also modulate the intrinsic properties of muscle stem cells, including reduced DNA accessibility and repression of specific genes by methylation. Finally we discuss the decrease in the stem cell pool, particularly the failure of elderly myoblasts to re-quiesce after activation, and the consequences of all these changes on general muscle homeostasis.},

As underlying mechanisms become better understood, FABPs may represent novel biomarkers for therapeutic targets. In addition, the role of FABPs as important signalling molecules has also been highlighted in recent years; for example, FABP3 may act as a myokine, matching whole-body metabolism to muscular energy demands and FABP4 functions as an adipokine in regulating macrophage and adipocyte interactions during inflammation. Summary In addition to their traditional role as fatty acid trafficking proteins, increasing evidence supports the role of FABPs as important controllers of global metabolism, with their dysregulation being linked to a host of metabolic diseases.

  abstract = {An influential book written by A. Mosso in the late 19th century proposed that fatigue that at first sight might appear an imperfection of our body, is on the contrary one of its most marvellous perfections. The fatigue increasing more rapidly than the amount of work done saves us from the injury which lesser sensibility would involve for the organism so that muscular fatigue also is at bottom an exhaustion of the nervous system.It has taken more than a century to confirm Mosso’s idea that both the brain and the muscles alter their function during exercise and that fatigue is predominantly an emotion, part of a complex regulation, the goal of which is to protect the body from harm. Mosso’s ideas were supplanted in the English literature by those of A.V. Hill who believed that fatigue was the result of biochemical changes in the exercising limb muscles - peripheral fatigue - to which the central nervous system makes no contribution. The past decade has witnessed the growing realization that this brainless model cannot explain exercise performance. This article traces the evolution of our modern understanding of how the CNS regulates exercise specifically to insure that each exercise bout terminates whilst homeostasis is retained in all bodily systems. The brain uses the symptoms of fatigue as key regulators to insure that the exercise is completed before harm develops. These sensations of fatigue are unique to each individual and are illusionary since their generation is largely independent of the real biological state of the athlete at the time they develop. The model predicts that attempts to understand fatigue and to explain superior human athletic performance purely on the basis of the body’s known physiological and metabolic responses to exercise must fail since subconscious and conscious mental decisions made by winners and losers, in both training and competition, are the ultimate determinants of both fatigue and athletic performance.},

Recent Findings: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified a multitude of loci influencing the variability of different bone or muscle parameters, with multiple loci overlapping between the traits. In addition, joint analyses of multiple correlated musculoskeletal traits (i.e., multivariate GWAS) have underscored several genes with possible pleiotropic effects on both bone and muscle including MEF2C and SREBF1. Notably, several of the proposed pleiotropic genes have been validated using human cells or animal models. Summary: It is clear that the study of pleiotropy may provide novel insights into disease pathophysiology potentially leading to the identification of new treatment strategies that simultaneously prevent or treat both osteoporosis and sarcopenia. However, the role of muscle factors (myokines) that stimulate bone metabolism, as well as osteokines that affect muscles, is in its earliest stage of understanding. © 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {White adipose tissue and skeletal muscle are the largest organs in the body and both are composed of distinct cell types. The signature cell of adipose tissue is the adipocyte while myocytes are the defining cell of skeletal muscle. White adipocytes are major secretory cells and this is increasingly apparent also for myocytes. Both cells secrete a range of bioactive proteins, generally termed adipokines in the case of adipocytes and myokines for muscle cells. There has, however, been some confusion over nomenclature and we suggest that the name myokine is restricted to a protein that is secreted from myocytes, while the term adipokine should be used to describe all proteins secreted from any type of adipocyte (white, brown or brite). These definitions specifically exclude proteins secreted from other cells within adipose tissue and muscle, including macrophages. There is some commonality between the myokines and adipokines in that both groups include inflammation-related proteins - for example, IL-6, Il-8 and MCP-1. Adipokines and myokines appear to be involved in local autocrine/paracrine interactions within adipose tissue and muscle, respectively. They are also involved in an endocrine cross-talk with other tissues, including between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and this may be bi-directional. For example, IL-6, secreted from myocytes may stimulate lipolysis in adipose tissue, while adipocyte-derived IL-6 may induce insulin resistance in muscle. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Movement and regular physical activity are two important factors that help the human body prevent, reduce and treat different chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, hypertension, sarcopenia, cachexia and cancer. During exercise, several tissues release molecules into the blood stream, and are able to mediate beneficial effects throughout the whole body. In particular, contracting skeletal muscle cells have the capacity to communicate with other organs through the release of humoral factors that play an important role in the mechanisms of adaptation to physical exercise. These muscle-derived factors, today recognized as myokines, act as endocrine and paracrine hormones. Moreover, exercise may stimulate the release of small membranous vesicles into circulation, whose composition is influenced by the same exercise. Combining the two hypotheses, these molecules related to exercise, named exer-kines, might be secreted from muscle cells inside small vesicles (nanovesicles). These could act as messengers in tissue cross talk during physical exercise. Thanks to their ability to deliver useful molecules (such as proteins and miRNA) in both physiological and pathological conditions, extracellular vesicles can be thought of as promising candidates for potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications for several diseases.

The endocrine system serves as a major clock output to regulate various biological processes. Recent findings suggest that some of the rhythmic hormones can also provide feedback to the circadian system at various levels, thus contributing to maintaining the robustness of endogenous rhythmicity. This delicate balance of clock-hormone interaction is vulnerable to modern lifestyle factors such as shiftwork or high-calorie diets, altering physiological set points. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the communication between the circadian timing and endocrine systems, with a focus on adrenal glucocorticoids and metabolic peptide hormones. We explore the potential role of hormones as systemic feedback signals to adjust clock function and their relevance for the maintenance of physiological and metabolic circadian homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Cancer is a disease associated with extreme human suffering, a huge economic cost to health systems, and is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Regular physical activity is associated with many health benefits, including reduced cancer risk. In the past two decades, exercising/contracting skeletal muscles have been found to secrete a wide range of biologically active proteins, named myokines. Myokines are delivered, via the circulation, to different cells/tissues, bind to their specific receptors and initiate signaling cascades mediating the health benefits of exercise. The present review summarizes the existing evidence of the role of the myokine irisin in cancer. In vitro studies have shown that the treatment of various cancer cells with irisin resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation, survival, migration/ invasion and induced apoptosis by affecting key proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling pathways. However, the effects of irisin in humans remains unclear. Although the majority of the existing studies have found reduced serum irisin levels in cancer patients, a few studies have shown the opposite. Similarly, the majority of studies have found increased levels of irisin in cancer tissues, with a few studies showing the opposite trend. Clearly, further investigations are required to determine the exact role of irisin in cancer. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Ten minutes of dynamic stretching is sufficient to potentiate vertical jump performance characteristics. J Strength Cond Res 25(9): 2453-2463, 2011—The current literature recommends dynamic rather than static stretching for the athletic warm-up. Dynamic stretching and various conditioning stimuli are used to induce potentiation in subsequent athletic performance. However, it is unknown as to which type of activity in conjunction with dynamic stretching within a warm-up provides the optimal potentiation of vertical jump performance. It was the objective of the study to examine the possible potentiating effect of various types of conditioning stimuli with dynamic stretching. Twenty athletes participated in 6 protocols. All the experimental protocols included 10 minutes of dynamic stretching. After the dynamic stretching, the subjects performed a (a) concentric (DS/CON): 3 sets of 3 repetition maximum deadlift exercise; (b) isometric (DS/ISOM): 3 sets of 3-second maximum voluntary contraction back squats; (c) plyometric (DS/PLYO): 3 sets of 3 tuck jumps; (d) eccentric (DS/ECC): 3 modified drop jumps; (e) dynamic stretching only (DS), and (f) control protocol (CON). Before the intervention and at recovery periods of 15 seconds, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 minutes, the participants performed 1-2 maximal countermovement jumps. The DS and DS/CON protocols generally had a 95-99\% likelihood of exceeding the smallest worthwhile change for vertical jump height, peak power, velocity and force. However, the addition of the deadlift to the DS did not augment the potentiating effect. Time-to-peak potentiation was variable between individuals but was most consistent between 3 and 5 minutes. Thus, the volume and the intensity associated with 10 minutes of dynamic stretching were sufficient to provide the potentiation of vertical jump characteristics. Additional conditioning activities may promote fatigue processes, which do not permit further potentiation.},

  abstract = {Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is a prevalent disorder characterized by recurrent apnea or hypoxia episodes leading to intermittent hypoxia (IH) and arousals during sleep. Currently, the relationship between SAS and metabolic diseases is being actively analyzed, and SAS is considered to be an independent risk factor for the development and progression of insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Accumulating evidence suggests that the short cycles of decreased oxygen saturation and rapid reoxygenation, a typical feature of SAS, contribute to the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. In addition to IH, several pathological conditions may also contribute to insulin resistance, including sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, oxidative stress, vascular endothelial dysfunction, and the activation of inflammatory cytokines. However, the detailed mechanism by which IH induces insulin resistance in SAS patients has not been fully revealed. We have previously reported that IH stress may exacerbate insulin resistance/T2DM, especially in hepatocytes, adipocytes, and skeletal muscle cells, by causing abnormal cytokine expression/secretion from each cell. Adipose tissues, skeletal muscle, and the liver are the main endocrine organs producing hepatokines, adipokines, and myokines, respectively. In this review, we focus on the effect of IH on hepatokine, adipokine, and myokine expression. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Inverse association between all-cause mortality and LDL-C was seen in 16 cohorts (in 14 with statistical significance) representing 92\% of the number of participants, where this association was recorded. In the rest, no association was found. In two cohorts, CV mortality was highest in the lowest LDL-C quartile and with statistical significance; in seven cohorts, no association was found.Conclusions High LDL-C is inversely associated with mortality in most people over 60\>years. This finding is inconsistent with the cholesterol hypothesis (ie, that cholesterol, particularly LDL-C, is inherently atherogenic). Since elderly people with high LDL-C live as long or longer than those with low LDL-C, our analysis provides reason to question the validity of the cholesterol hypothesis. Moreover, our study provides the rationale for a re-evaluation of guidelines recommending pharmacological reduction of LDL-C in the elderly as a component of cardiovascular disease prevention strategies.},

It was found that the imagination and mental toughness of the participants did not differ according to the gender variable. The imagination levels of the participants who are interested in team sports and who are engaged in individual sports do not differ significantly. When we look at the results obtained within the scope of correlation analysis in the study, it was found that there is a moderate and positive relationship between imagination and mental toughness. As a result of the regression analysis, it was found that imagination in sports has a significant positive contribution in explaining its effect on mental toughness. It can be said that the higher the level of imagination in sports, the higher the mental toughness.},

  abstract = {Obesity, accumulation of adipose tissue, develops when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. Adipose tissue is essential for buffering the differences between energy intake and expenditure by accumulating lipids while skeletal muscle is the energy burning machine. Here we adopted the concept that (i) adipose tissue ability to regulate the storage capacity for lipids as well as (ii) dynamic regulation of muscle and adipose tissue secretory and metabolic activity is important for maintaining the metabolic health. This might be at least in part related to tissue plasticity, a phenomenon enabling dynamic modulation of the tissue phenotype in different physiological and pathophysiological situations. Recent advances in our understanding of the complex endocrine function of adipose tissue in regulating lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling, inflammation and oxidative stress prompted us to review the role of tissue plasticity-dynamic changes in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle metabolic and endocrine phenotype-in determining the difference between metabolic health and disease. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.},

For this purpose the ratio VE/[LA] (l/min/mmol/l) was determined at each particular pH corresponding to exercise intensity in seven healthy subjects on the cycle ergometer during incremental exercise test. Changes in VE/[LA] ratio were found to exhibit three phases. In the first phase, the ratio increased without significant changes in [LA] and pH until it reached certain individual peak value. In the second phase, VE/[LA] decreased because increases in [LA] were considerably bigger than those of VE. Decreases in blood pH followed those of VE/[LA], nevertheless differences existed among subjects depending on how successful individual subjects regulated their blood pH. In the third phase with the VE/[LA] values stabilized between 15 and 22 and pH values between 7.32 and 7.26, whereas differences between subjects became negligible. Similar trends to VE/[LA] were observed in case of the Onset of Blood Lactate Accumulation (OBLA) throughout the test at pH values below 7.32, as was manifested by the correlation coefficient. We conclude that blood pH regulation due to respiratory compensation of the lactate acidosis is more successful in subjects with better endurance (higher OBLA), but only when [LA] is slightly increased or at slight acidosis.},

  abstract = {Many children strive to attain excellence in sport. However, although talent identification and development programmes have gained popularity in recent decades, there remains a lack of consensus in relation to how talent should be defined or identified and there is no uniformly accepted theoretical framework to guide current practice. The success rates of talent identification and development programmes have rarely been assessed and the validity of the models applied remains highly debated. This article provides an overview of current knowledge in this area with special focus on problems associated with the identification of gifted adolescents. There is a growing agreement that traditional cross-sectional talent identification models are likely to exclude many, especially late maturing, promising children from development programmes due to the dynamic and multidimensional nature of sport talent. A conceptual framework that acknowledges both genetic and environmental influences and considers the dynamic and multidimensional nature of sport talent is presented. The relevance of this model is highlighted and recommendations for future work provided. It is advocated that talent identification and development programmes should be dynamic and interconnected taking into consideration maturity status and the potential to develop rather than to exclude children at an early age. Finally, more representative real-world tasks should be developed and employed in a multidimensional design to increase the efficacy of talent identification and development programmes.

In particular, increases in the number of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and improvements in the gut barrier integrity with re-duced endotoxemia seem to be key points for positive interactions between gut health and T2DM, resulting in improvements in low-grade systemic inflammation status and glycemic control. How-ever, not all aspects are known in detail and further studies are needed to further examine the efficacy of different training programs, the role of myokines, SCFA-producing bacteria, and SCFAs in the relevant metabolic pathways. As microbial signatures differ in individuals who respond differ-ently to exercise training programs, one scientific focus could be the development of computer-based methods for the personalized analysis of the gut microbiota in the context of a microbiota/mi-crobiome-based training program. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract = {Although there is no unanimity, growing evidence supports the value of regular physical exercise to prevent Alzheimer's disease as well as cognitive decline in affected patients. Together with an introductory summary on epidemiological evidence, the aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the potential biological mechanisms underlying exercise benefits in this condition. Regular physical exercise has proven to be beneficial for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., reduced vascular flow, diabetes) involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Exercise also promotes neurogenesis via increases in exercise-induced metabolic factors (e.g., ketone bodies, lactate) and muscle-derived myokines (cathepsin-B, irisin), which in turn stimulate the production of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Finally, regular exercise exerts anti-inflammatory effects and improves the brain redox status, thereby ameliorating the pathophysiological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (e.g., amyloid-β deposition). In summary, physical exercise might provide numerous benefits through different pathways that might, in turn, help prevent risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease. More evidence is needed, however, based on human studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Growing evidence supports the use of lifestyle interventions for the prevention and adjuvant treatment of hypertension. In this Review, we provide a summary of the epidemiological research supporting the preventive and antihypertensive effects of major lifestyle interventions (regular physical exercise, body weight management and healthy dietary patterns), as well as other less traditional recommendations such as stress management and the promotion of adequate sleep patterns coupled with circadian entrainment. We also discuss the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of these lifestyle interventions on hypertension, which include not only the prevention of traditional risk factors (such as obesity and insulin resistance) and improvements in vascular health through an improved redox and inflammatory status, but also reduced sympathetic overactivation and non-traditional mechanisms such as increased secretion of myokines. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.}

Twelve healthy college students (8 men, 4 women; mean age=22±2 years) performed long (90-95\% of peak heart rate) and short intervals (maximal intensity) of high-intensity training (running on a non-motorized treadmill) with the same total duration on separate days. The total volume of consumed oxygen during recovery was the same in both cases ( P =0.21), whereas the short intervals of high-intensity training were performed at a faster mean running velocity (3.5±0.18 vs. 2.95±0.07\,m/s) and at a lower RPE breath compared with the long intervals of high-intensity training. The blood lactate concentration also tended to be lower during the short intervals of high-intensity training, indicating that short-interval training was perceived to be easier than long-interval training, even though the cardiovascular and metabolic responses are similar. Furthermore, EPOC lasted significantly longer (83.4±3.2 vs. 61.3±27.9\,min, P =0.016) and tended to be higher (8.02±4.22=vs. 5.70±3.75\,L O 2 , P =0.053) after short intervals than after long intervals of training.},

To assess the effects of epinephrine infusions of varying duration on in vivo responses to LPS, the following experiments were performed: (a) Blood obtained from eight subjects at 4-24 h after the start of a 24-h infusion of epinephrine (30 ng/kg per min) produced less TNF after ex vivo stimulation with LPS compared with blood drawn before the start of the infusion, and (b) 17 healthy men who were receiving a continuous infusion of epinephrine (30 ng/kg per min) started either 3 h (EPI-3; n = 5) or 24 h (EPI-24; n = 6) were studied after intravenous injection of LPS (2 ng/kg, lot EC-5). EPI-3 inhibited LPS-induced in vivo TNF appearance and also increased IL-10 release (both P {$<$} 0.005 versus LPS), whereas EPI-24 only attenuated TNF secretion (P = 0.05). In separate in vitro experiments in whole blood, epinephrine increased LPS-induced IL-10 release by a combined effect on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Further, in LPS-stimulated blood, the increase on IL-10 levels caused by epinephrine only marginally contributed to concurrent inhibition of TNF production. Epinephrine, either endogenously produced or administered as a component of sepsis treatment, may have a net antiinflammatory effect on the cytokine network early in the course of systemic infection.},

  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were initially characterized as “garbage bags” with the purpose of removing unwanted material from cells. It is now becoming clear that EVs mediate intercellular communication between distant cells through a transfer of genetic material, a process important to the systemic adaptation in physiological and pathological conditions. Although speculative, it has been suggested that the majority of EVs that make it into the bloodstream would be coming from skeletal muscle, since it is one of the largest organs in the human body. Although it is well established that skeletal muscle secretes peptides (currently known as myokines) into the bloodstream, the notion that skeletal muscle releases EVs is in its infancy. Besides intercellular communication and systemic adaptation, EV release could represent the mechanism by which muscle adapts to certain stimuli. This review summarizes the current understanding of EV biology and biogenesis and current isolation methods and briefly discusses the possible role EVs have in regulating skeletal muscle mass. © 2019 the American Physiological Society},

  abstract = {Regular exercise has a central role in human health by reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity, stroke and cancer. How exercise is able to promote such systemic benefits has remained somewhat of a mystery but has been thought to be in part mediated by the release of myokines, skeletal muscle-specific cytokines, in response to exercise. Recent studies have revealed skeletal muscle can also release extracellular vesicles (EVs) into circulation following a bout of exercise. EVs are small membrane-bound vesicles capable of delivering biomolecules to recipient cells and subsequently altering their metabolism. The notion that EVs may have a role in both skeletal muscle and systemic adaptation to exercise has generated a great deal of excitement within a number of different fields including exercise physiology, neuroscience and metabolism. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to EV biology and what is currently known about skeletal muscle EVs and their potential role in the response of muscle and other tissues to exercise.

  abstract = {ABSTRACTThere has been a rapid proliferation of empirical research on the relationship between sport participation and mental health. As a result of this movement, there has been an increased focus on the constructs that can predict or explain mental health outcomes in sport. Psychological safety in sport is among the constructs surfaced in the movement. Despite this, there is a considerable lack of conceptual clarity regarding how to define psychological safety and how it can be fostered in sport. As such, the aim of this study was to provide conceptual clarity of the term psychological safety in the context of sport. To achieve this aim, we first systematically searched for all currently available studies that have discussed psychological safety in a sport context. Then, a concept analysis approach was applied wherein the definitions, attributes, antecedents, and consequences were thematically analysed across 67 studies. As a result of this synthesis, psychological safety in sport was conceptualised as a continuous, group level construct that is perceived (and reported) at an individual level. We also provide a descriptive model of psychological safety in sport that we hope lends clarity and debate to the field moving forward.},

  abstract = {The intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is a depot of adipocytes located between muscle bundles. Several investigations have recently been carried out to define the phenotype, the functional characteristics, and the origin of the adipocytes present in this depot. Among the different mechanisms that could be responsible for the accumulation of fat in this site, the dysdifferentiation of muscle-derived stem cells or other mesenchymal progenitors has been postulated, turning them into cells with an adipocyte phenotype. In particular, muscle satellite cells (SCs), a heterogeneous stem cell population characterized by plasticity and self-renewal that allow muscular growth and regeneration, can acquire features of adipocytes, including the abilities to express adipocyte-specific genes and accumulate lipids. Failure to express the transcription factors that direct mesenchymal precursors into fully differentiated functionally specialized cells may be responsible for their phenotypic switch into the adipogenic lineage. We proved that human SCs also possess a clear adipogenic potential that could explain the presence of mature adipocytes within skeletal muscle. This occurs under some pathological conditions (i.e., primary myodystrophies, obesity, hyperglycemia, high plasma free fatty acids, hypoxia, etc.) or as a consequence of thiazolidinedione treatment or simply because of a sedentary lifestyle or during aging. Several pathways and factors (PPARs, WNT growth factors, myokines, GEF-GAP-Rho, p66 shc, mitochondrial ROS production, PKCβ) could be implicated in the adipogenic conversion of SCs. The understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate muscle-to-fat conversion and SC behavior could explain the increase in IMAT depots that characterize many metabolic diseases and age-related sarcopenia.

  abstract = {IL-6 is usually described as a pleiotropic cytokine produced in response to tissue injury or infection. As a pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 activates innate and adaptative immune responses. IL-6 is released in the innate immune response by leukocytes as well as stromal cells upon pattern recognition receptor activation. IL-6 then recruits immune cells and triggers B and T cell response. Dysregulated IL-6 activity is associated with pathologies involving chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, including atherosclerosis. However, IL-6 is also produced and released under beneficial conditions, such as exercise, where IL-6 is associated with the anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects coupled with physical adaptation to intense training. Exercise-associated IL-6 acts on adipose tissue to induce lipogenesis and on arteries to induce adaptative vascular remodeling. These divergent actions could be explained by complex signaling networks. Classical IL-6 signaling involves a membrane-bound IL-6 receptor and glycoprotein 130 (gp130), while trans-signaling relies on a soluble version of IL-6R (sIL-6R) and membrane-bound gp130. Trans-signaling, but not the classical pathway, is regulated by soluble gp130. In this review, we discuss the similarities and differences in IL-6 cytokine and myokine signaling to explain the differential and opposite effects of this protein during inflammation and exercise, with a special focus on the vascular system. © Copyright © 2021 Villar-Fincheira, Sanhueza-Olivares, Norambuena-Soto, Cancino-Arenas, Hernandez-Vargas, Troncoso, Gabrielli and Chiong.},

We propose that the facilitation of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP)-related pathways, by products induced by physical exercise (i.e., exerkines), is a crucial aspect of the exercise-effect on the brain. This review summarizes synaptic pathways that are activated by exerkines and may potentiate LTP. For a total of 16 exerkines, we indicated how blood and brain exerkine levels are altered depending on the type of physical exercise (i.e., cardiovascular or resistance exercise) and how they respond to a single bout (i.e., acute exercise) or multiple bouts of physical exercise (i.e., chronic exercise). This information may be used for designing individualized physical exercise programs. Finally, this review may serve to direct future research towards fundamental gaps in our current knowledge regarding the biophysical interactions between muscle activity and the brain at both cellular and system levels. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract = {This review gives an overview of methods and outcomes of studies that compared circulatory, ventilatory, energetic or hormonal responses evoked by single-leg cycling and double-leg cycling at sub-maximal and maximal intensities. Through a systematic search, 18 studies were identified in the databases PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Additionally, one study was added after a check of references. Critical analysis of each study showed that their quality was low to moderate. Between studies, widely divergent study procedures were present, such as different intensities, incremental or constant workloads, and different cycling frequencies. Moreover, a large variety of outcome variables was found and thereby comparison was hard. Nevertheless, results showed a tendency to higher hormonal levels of catecholamines as well as circulatory and ventilatory responses during double-leg cycling compared to one-leg cycling. Additionally, at similar normalized submaximal workloads, blood lactate levels tended to be lower during double-leg cycling, suggesting that more type II muscle fibers were recruited. From the reviewed studies the tentative conclusion is that active muscle mass seems a crucial factor in the regulation of endurance performance. Consequently, exercise regimens that recruit a larger active muscle mass, for example combined arm and leg exercise, would optimally stress the release of biochemicals and hence the modulation of central training adaptations, which may positively affect physical capacity in, for example, persons that have diminished leg muscle mass available. However, it also became clear that more information is needed to further understand the contributions of active muscle mass. The experimental possibilities of comparing one-legged and two-legged cycling is promising, but future studies should aim to provide complete quantitative data on the muscle mass recruited, as well as on the specific contribution of anaerobic/aerobic metabolism. They should also aim to include blood parameters such as PCO2, pH, myokines and physiological responses such as heart rate and ventilation. © 2018, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Kinesiology.

  abstract = {It is recognized that obesity contributes to cardiovascular and metabolic disorders through alterations in the levels of adipocyte-derived cytokines (adipokines). Adiponectin is an adipokine that is downregulated in obese individuals. It has beneficial actions on the cardiovascular system by directly acting on the heart and blood vessels, and acute administration of adiponectin can minimize the tissue damage resulting from myocardial infarction. More recent research has been aimed at identifying novel adiponectin-like factors involved in metabolic and cardiovascular regulation. Activation of Akt, a protein kinase involved in cell signaling, has been implicated in the control of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. An experimental mouse model demonstrates that substantial increases in muscle fiber hypertrophy, weight and strength occur upon induction of Akt signaling in skeletal muscle. In a mouse model of obesity, the increase in muscle mass caused by myogenic Akt induction results in diminished fat deposition and improvements in whole body metabolism. Based on these findings a protocol to identify novel muscle-secreted proteins (myokines) that confer the phenotypic changes brought on by myogenic Akt induction has been devised. One of these newly discovered factors, referred to as follistatin-like 1, is able to promote revascularization in ischemic limbs and protect the heart from ischemic stress.},

  abstract = {Bone-forming cells build mineralized microstructure and couple with bone-resorbing cells, harmonizing bone mineral acquisition, and remodeling to maintain bone mass homeostasis. Mitochondrial glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways together with ROS generation meet the energy requirement for bone-forming cell growth and differentiation, respectively. Moder-ate mechanical stimulations, such as weight loading, physical activity, ultrasound, vibration, and electromagnetic field stimulation, etc., are advantageous to bone-forming cell activity, promoting bone anabolism to compromise osteoporosis development. A plethora of molecules, including ion channels, integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and myokines, are mechanosensitive and transduce mechanical stimuli into intercellular signaling, regulating growth, mineralized extracellular matrix biosynthesis, and resorption. Mechanical stimulation changes mitochondrial respiration, biogenesis, dynamics, calcium influx, and redox, whereas mechanical disuse induces mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which aggravates bone-forming cell apoptosis, senescence, and dysfunction. The control of the mitochondrial biogenesis activator PGC-1α by NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirtuins or myokine FNDC/irisin or repression of oxidative stress by mitochondrial antioxidant Nrf2 modulates the biophysical stimulation for the promotion of bone integrity. This review sheds light onto the roles of mechanosensitive signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, and antioxidants in mediating the anabolic effects of biophysical stimulation to bone tissue and highlights the remedial potential of mitochondrial biogenesis regulators for osteoporosis. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {E-cigarettes are promoted as healthier alternatives to conventional cigarettes. Many cigarette smokers use both products. It is unknown whether the additional use of e-cigarettes among cigarette smokers (dual users) is associated with reduced exposure to tobacco-related health risks. Cross-sectional analysis was performed using baseline data from the Health eHeart Study, among English-speaking adults, mostly from the United States. Cigarette use (\# cigarettes/day) and/or e-cigarette use (\# days, \# cartridges, and \# puffs) were compared between cigarette only users vs. dual users. Additionally, we examined cardiopulmonary symptoms/ conditions across product use: no product (neither), e-cigarettes only, cigarettes only, and dual use. Among 39,747 participants, 573 (1.4\%) reported e-cigarette only use, 1,693 (4.3\%) reported cigarette only use, and 514 (1.3\%) dual use. Dual users, compared to cigarette only users, reported a greater median (IQR) number of cigarettes per day, 10.0 (4.0-20.0) vs. 9.0 (3.0-15.0) (p {$<$} .0001), a lower (worse) median (IQR) SF-12 general health score, 3.3 (2.8-3.8) vs. 3.5 (2.8-3.9) (p = .0014), and a higher (worse) median (IQR) breathing difficulty score in the past month, 2.0 (1.0-2.0) vs. 1.0 (1.0-2.0) (p = .001). Of the 19 cardiopulmonary symptoms/ conditions, having a history of arrhythmia was significantly different between cigarette only users (14.2\%) and dual users (17.8\%) (p = .02). In this sample, dual use was not associated with reduced exposure to either (i) cigarettes, compared to cigarette only users or (ii) e-cigarettes, compared to e-cigarette only users. E-cigarette only use, compared to no product use, was associated with lower general health scores, higher breathing difficulty scores (typically and past month), and greater proportions of those who responded 'yes' to having chest pain, palpitations, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, COPD, and asthma. These data suggest the added use of e-cigarettes alone may have contributed to cardiopulmonary health risks particularly respiratory health risks.},

  abstract = {Emerging evidence indicates that moderate intensity aerobic exercise is positively correlated with cognitive function and memory. However, the exact mechanisms underlying such improvements remain unclear. Recent research in animal models allows proposition of a pathway in which brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key mediator. This perspective draws upon evidence from animal and human studies to highlight such a mechanism whereby exercise drives synthesis and accumulation of neuroactive metabolites such as myokines and ketone bodies in the periphery and in the hippocampus to enhance BDNF expression. BDNF is a neurotrophin with well-established properties of promoting neuronal survival and synaptic integrity, while its influence on energy transduction may provide the crucial link between inherent vascular and metabolic benefits of exercise with enhanced brain function. Indeed, BDNF mRNA and protein is robustly elevated in rats following periods of voluntary exercise. This was also correlated with improved spatial memory, while such benefits were abolished upon inhibition of BDNF signaling. Similarly, both BDNF and cardiovascular fitness arising from aerobic exercise have been positively associated with hippocampal volume and function in humans. We postulate that exercise will attenuate cortical atrophy and synaptic loss inherent to neurodegenerative disorders - many of which also exhibit aberrant down-regulation of BDNF. Thus, the proposed link between BDNF, exercise and cognition may have critical therapeutic implications for the prevention and amelioration of memory loss and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease and associated dementias. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

In phase one, the authors preliminarily selected the indexes through literature, and further screened the preliminarily selected indexes by means of expert questionnaire, and then carried out experimental test on the determined indexes, used anaerobic threshold heart rate as an independent variable and the screened indexes as independent variables for regression, and established an individual anaerobic threshold heart rate regression equation; in phase two, the authors carried out paired samples t test on the anaerobic threshold heart rate calculated by the regression equation and the anaerobic threshold heart rate measured, and carried out back substitution test; in phase three, the authors let the testees have 12-week training by using the anaerobic threshold heart rate calculated by the regression equation as the load intensity, so as to check the practical application effect. The results showed the followings: 1) the results of the paired t test on the predicted values and actually observed values of the testees showed no significant different (P{$>$}0.005); the authors carried out correlation analysis on the predicted values and actually observed values, and again verified that their consistency was high (r=0.889, P{$<$}0.001); 2) after the 12-week training, the VO2max of the experiment group increased significantly as compared to that before the training (P{$<$}0.01), the VO2max of the control group had no significant difference as compared to that before the training (P{$>$}0.05); in VO2max comparison, the experiment group’s was significantly higher than the control group’s (P{$<$}0.01). The results indicated the followings: using individual anaerobic threshold heart rate as a load intensity monitoring index is recommended for the activity of high school boys going for “Sunshine Long Distance Run”； the individual anaerobic threshold heart rate regression equation is: Y=111.537+6.076×x10.2821×x2—0.569xx3+9.944xx4 (where x1 is age, x2 is height, x3 is basic heart rate, x4 is body surface area).

  abstract = {Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is defined as the total combined damage that occurs during a period of ischemia and following the recovery of blood flow. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an inflammatory response are factors contributing to IRI-related damage that can each result in cell death. Irisin is a polypeptide that is proteolytically cleaved from the extracellular domain of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5). Irisin acts as a myokine that potentially mediates beneficial effects of exercise by reducing oxidative stress, improving mitochondrial fitness, and suppressing inflammation. The existing literature also suggests a possible link between irisin and IRI, involving mechanisms similar to those associated with exercise. This article will review the pathogenesis of IRI and the potential benefits and current limitations of irisin as a therapeutic strategy for IRI, while highlighting the mechanistic correlations between irisin and IRI. © 2021 Yani Wang et al.}

  abstract = {The prevalence of obesity is escalating and has become a worldwide health challenge coinciding with the development of metabolic diseases. Emerging evidence has shown that obesity is accompanied by the infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue, contributing to a state of low-grade chronic inflammation and dysregulated metabolism. Moreover, in the state of obesity, the phenotype of adipose tissue macrophages switches from the M2 polarized state to the M1 state, thereby contributing to chronic inflammation. Notably, multiple metabolic organs (adipose tissue, gut, skeletal muscle, and the liver) communicate with adipose tissue macrophages via secreting organokines or exosomes. In this review, we systematically summarize how the organokines (adipokines, gut microbiota and its metabolites, gut cytokines, myokines, and hepatokines) and exosomes (adipocyte-, skeletal muscle-, and hepatocyte-derived exosomes) act as important triggers for macrophage recruitment in adipose tissue and adipose tissue macrophage polarization, thus providing further insight into obesity treatment. In addition, we also highlight the complex interaction of organokines with organokines and organokines with exosomes, revealing new paths in understanding adipose tissue macrophage recruitment and polarization.

After a decade of extensive investigation on FNDC5/irisin, we are still surrounded by lots of open questions regarding its diagnostic and therapeutic values. In this review, we first concentrated on the structure-function relationship of FNDC5/irisin. Next, we comprehensively summarised the current knowledge and research findings regarding pathogenic roles/therapeutic applications of FNDC5/irisin in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fibrosis, liver injury due to multiple detrimental insults, hepatic malignancy and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Moreover, the prominent molecules involved in the underlying mechanisms and signalling pathways were highlighted. As a result, emerging evidence reveals FNDC5/irisin may act as a proxy for diagnosing liver disease pathology, a sensitive biomarker for assessing damage severity, a predisposing factor for surveilling illness progression and a treatment option with protective/preventive impact, all of which are highly dependent on disease grading and contextually pathological features.

  abstract = {When improving athletic performance in sports with high-speed strength demands such as soccer, basketball, or track and field, the most common training method might be resistance training and plyometrics. Since a link between strength capacity and speed strength exists and recently published literature suggested chronic stretching routines may enhance maximum strength and hypertrophy, this review was performed to explore potential benefits on athletic performance. Based on current literature, a beneficial effect of static stretching on jumping and sprinting performance was hypothesized. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science and Google scholar. In general, 14 studies revealed 29 effect sizes (ES) (20 for jumping, nine for sprinting). Subgroup analyses for jump performance were conducted for short- long- and no stretch shortening cycle trials. Qualitative evaluation was supplemented by performing a multilevel meta-analysis via R (Package: metafor). Significant positive results were documented in six out of 20 jump tests and in six out of nine sprint tests, while two studies reported negative adaptations. Quantitative data analyses indicated a positive but trivial magnitude of change on jumping performance (ES:0.16,               p               = 0.04), while all subgroup analyses did not support a positive effect (               p               = 0.09–0.44). No significant influence of static stretching on sprint performance was obtained (               p               = 0.08). Stretching does not seem to induce a sufficient stimulus to meaningfully enhance jumping and sprinting performance, which could possibly attributed to small weekly training volumes or lack of intensity.},

  abstract = {Cachexia is the involuntary loss of muscle and adipose tissue that strongly affects mortality and treatment efficacy in patients with cancer or chronic inflammatory disease. Currently, no specific treatments or interventions are available for patients developing this disorder. Given the well-documented involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines in muscle and fat metabolism in physiological responses and in the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory disease and cancer, considerable interest has revolved around their role in mediating cachexia. This has been supported by association studies that report increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in some, but not all, cancers and in chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, preclinical studies including animal disease models have provided a substantial body of evidence implicating a causal contribution of systemic inflammation to cachexia. The presence of inflammatory cytokines can affect skeletal muscle through several direct mechanisms, relying on activation of the corresponding receptor expressed by muscle, and resulting in inhibition of muscle protein synthesis (MPS), elevation of catabolic activity through the ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS) and autophagy, and impairment of myogenesis. Additionally, systemic inflammatory mediators indirectly contribute to muscle wasting through dysregulation of tissue and organ systems, including GCs via the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the digestive system leading to anorexia-cachexia, and alterations in liver and adipocyte behavior, which subsequently impact on muscle. Finally, myokines secreted by skeletal muscle itself in response to inflammation have been implicated as autocrine and endocrine mediators of cachexia, as well as potential modulators of this debilitating condition. While inflammation has been shown to play a pivotal role in cachexia development, further understanding how these cytokines contribute to disease progression is required to reveal biomarkers or diagnostic tools to help identify at risk patients, or enable the design of targeted therapies to prevent or delay the progression of cachexia. © Copyright © 2020 Webster, Kempen, Hardy and Langen.},

  abstract = {Regular physical activity not only improves the exercise capacity of the skeletal muscle performing the contractions, but~it is beneficial for the whole body. An extensive search for “exercise factors” mediating these beneficial effects has been going on for decades. Particularly skeletal muscle tissue has been investigated as a source of circulating exercise factors, and several myokines have been identified. However, exercise also has an impact on other tissues. The liver is interposed between energy storing and energy utilising tissues and is highly active during exercise, maintaining energy homeostasis. Recently, a novel group of exercise factors—termed hepatokines—has emerged. These proteins (fibroblast growth factor 21, follistatin, angiopoietin-like protein 4, heat shock protein 72, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1) are released from the liver and increased in the bloodstream during or in the recovery after an exercise bout. In this narrative review, we evaluate this new group of exercise factors focusing on the regulation and potential function in exercise metabolism and adaptations. These hepatokines may convey some of the beneficial whole-body effects of exercise that could ameliorate metabolic diseases, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Recent years have provided clear evidence for the skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. Muscle contraction during physical activity has emerged as an important activator of the release of the proteins and peptides called "myokines." Diverse proteomic profiling approaches were applied to rodent and human skeletal muscle cells to characterize the complete secretome, to study the regulation of the secretome during cell differentiation or the release of myokines upon contractile activity of myotubes. Several of the exercise-regulated factors have the potency to mediate an interorgan crosstalk. The paracrine function of the secreted peptides and proteins to regulate muscle regeneration, tissue remodeling, and trainability can have direct effects on whole-body glucose disposal and oxygen consumption. The overall composition and dynamic of the myokinome are still incompletely characterized. Recent advantages in metabolomics and lipidomics will add metabolites and lipids with autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine function to the contraction-induced secretome of the skeletal muscle. The identification of these metabolites will lead to a more comprehensive view described by a new myo(metabo)kinome consisting of peptides, proteins, and metabolites. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Some of these episodes of cognitive impairment may be treatable, with treatment not offered owing to the perception of ultimate futility or expense, or both. One of the causes of terminal loss of consciousness or decreased lucidity can be inadequate cerebral oxygen delivery. We report five cases from four institutions where an infusion of a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier to patients who were unconscious or not lucid owing to acute severe anemia (hemoglobin range, 2.1-5.2 g/dL) resulted in awakening or lucidity. We review briefly human cognitive function and anemia and remark about the use of a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier for acute severe anemia when red cell transfusion is not an option.},

  abstract = {Although much feared by clinicians, the ability to produce ketones has allowed humans to withstand prolonged periods of starvation. At such times, ketones can supply up to 50\% of basal energy requirements. More interesting, however, is the fact that ketones can provide as much as 70\% of the brain's energy needs, more efficiently than glucose. Studies suggest that during times of acute brain injury, cerebral uptake of ketones increases significantly. Researchers have thus attempted to attenuate the effects of cerebral injury by administering ketones exogenously. Hypertonic saline is commonly utilized for management of intracranial hypertension following cerebral injury. A solution containing both hypertonic saline and ketones may prove ideal for managing the dual problems of refractory intracranial hypertension and low cerebral energy levels. The purpose of the present review is to explore the physiology of ketone body utilization by the brain in health and in a variety of neurological conditions, and to discuss the potential for ketone supplementation as a therapeutic option in traumatic brain injury.},

MG53, a tripartite motif-containing family protein, is such a myokine which has protective effects on lungs, kidneys, liver, heart, eye, and brain. Three mechanisms of action for the beneficial regenerative medicine potential of MG53 have been identified and consist of 1) repair of acute injury to the cellular membrane, 2) anti-inflammatory effects associated with chronic injuries, and 3) rejuvenation of stem cells for tissue regeneration. As such, MG53 has the potential to be a novel and effective regeneration medicine therapeutic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Setting:~           National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletic program.           Participants:~           Cohorts of 188 and 146 college athletes who participated during successive academic years.           Assessment of Risk Factors:~           The first cohort provided responses to 4 joint-specific outcome surveys that were related to subsequent time-loss injury occurrence. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified survey items that provided best discrimination, which were combined with a negative life event stress item to create a new 10-item survey. The second cohort provided responses to the new survey, which were converted to a 0 to 100 score.           Main Outcome Measures:~           Construct validity was assessed through documentation of time-loss injuries sustained during the preceding 12 months and predictive validity was assessed through prospective documentation of sport-related sprains and strains. Cronbach alpha was calculated to assess internal consistency.           Results:~           Each of the outcome survey items used to develop the new survey demonstrated much greater specificity than sensitivity. Both the retrospective and prospective receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses identified scores of 96 and 88 as cut-points that provided good discrimination between injured and noninjured cases. The area under the curve was 0.69 (P {$<$} 0.001) for the retrospective analysis and 0.62 (P = 0.016) for the prospective analysis. Cronbach alpha was 0.89 (90\% CI, 0.86-0.91).           Conclusions:~           Self-reported effects of previous injury may be one method to efficiently identify athletes who possess elevated injury risk, and subsequently deliver preventive interventions, thereby providing an alternative method to time-intensive functional testing.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

In addition to decreasing performance in-flight (chronic) fatigue has negative long-term health effects. Possible causes of fatigue include sleep loss, extended time awake, circadian phase irregularities and work load. Despite regulations limiting flight time and enabling optimal rostering, fatigue cannot be prevented completely. Especially in military operations, where limits may be extended due to operational necessities, it is impossible to rely solely on regulations to prevent fatigue. Fatigue management, consisting of preventive strategies and operational countermeasures, such as pre-flight naps and pharmaceuticals that either promote adequate sleep (hypnotics or chronobiotics) or enhance performance (stimulants), may be required to mitigate fatigue in challenging (military) aviation operations. This review describes the pathophysiology, epidemiology and effects of fatigue and its impact on aviation, as well as several aspects of fatigue management and recommendations for future research in this field.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aircraft passengers and crew may be subjected to rapid or prolonged decompression to high cabin altitude when an aircraft develops a hole in the fuselage. The accepted measure of neurological damage due to the hypobaric hypoxia produced is the subjective 'time of useful consciousness' (TUC) measure, which is appropriate for pilots and crew who perform their given tasks, however, TUC is measured under conditions different than the decompression scenarios that passengers undergo in today's aircraft. METHODS: Ernsting proposed that prolonged exposure to alveolar O2 pressures less than 30 mmHg (P30) causes neurological damage. The current study proposes that a critical value of arterial O2 saturation of 70\% (S70) can be used in place of P30 and that this physiological measure is more suited for determination of hypobaric hypoxia in passengers. RESULTS: The study shows the equivalence of model-predicted P30 and S70 values in the Ernsting-decompression scenarios. The model is also used to predict values of these physiological measures in actual aircraft-decompression scenarios. DISCUSSION: The model can be used by others to quantitatively predict the degree of hypobaric hypoxia for virtually any kind of decompression scenario, including those where supplemental O2 is used. Use of this tool avoids the prohibitive costs of human-subject testing for new aircraft and the potential danger inherent in such tests.},

  abstract = {In the past decades, skeletal muscle has become the focus of numerous studies due to its potential physiological role as an endocrine organ secreting hundreds of myokines. Among these myokines, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and irisin are novel hormone polypeptides sending signals to regulate the function of specific organs, like skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue. Both hormones have been reported to normalize glucose, improve insulin resistance, and promote lipid homeostasis, thereby preventing the development of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes. Besides preserving pancreatic β-cell functions, FGF21 also protects pancreatic acini from inflammation and reduces proteotoxic stress via facilitating digestive enzyme secretion. Meanwhile, irisin is found to inhibit the pancreatic cancer cell growth as well. This review attempts to focus on the current knowledge of FGF21 and irisin and their effective roles in pancreas including pancreatic β- and acinar cells under various physiological conditions, its anti-diabetic actions, and the clinical implications. © 2020 The Chinese Medical Association, Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc..},

In practice, muscle quality as well as muscle mass might determine the strength and physical performance. A new diagnostic algorithm of sarcopenia has recently been established, in which low muscle strength is a key characteristic factor for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Although many factors are supposed to be involved in the pathology and development of sarcopenia, precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

  abstract = {The causes of dentofacial deformities include various known syndromes, genetics, environmental and neuromuscular factors, trauma, and tumors. Above all, the functional effects of muscles are important, and deformation of the mandible is often associated with a mechanical imbalance of the masticatory muscles. With the vertical position of the face, weakness of the sling of the masseter muscle and medial pterygoid muscle causes dilatation of the mandibular angle. In patients with a deep bite, excessive function of the masticatory muscles is reported. Myosin heavy chain (MyHC) properties also affect jawbone morphology. In short-face patients, the proportion of type II fibers, which are fast muscles, is high. The proportions of muscle fiber types are genetically determined but can be altered by postnatal environmental factors. Orthognathic surgery may results in the transition of MyHC to type II (fast) fibers, but excessive stretching enhances the release of inflammatory mediators and causes a shift toward a greater proportion of slow muscle fibers. This feature can be related to postoperative relapse. Bones and muscles are in close crosstalk, and it may be possible to use biochemical approaches as well as biomechanical considerations for the treatment of jaw deformities. © 2020 The Authors},

  abstract = {The prevalence of obesity has risen to an unprecedented level. According to World Health Organization, over 500 million adults, equivalent to 10\%–14\% of the world population, were obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater in 2008.1 This rising prevalence and earlier onset of obesity is believed to be resulted from an interplay of genetic factors, over-nutrition and physical inactivity in modern lifestyles. Obesity also increases the susceptibility to metabolic syndromes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cancer.2-4 The global obesity epidemic has sparked substantial interests in the biology of adipose tissue (fat). In addition, the skeletal muscle and its secretive factors (myokines) have also been shown to play a critical role in controlling body energy balance, adipose homeostasis and inflammation status. 5 Interestingly, skeletal muscle cells share a common developmental origin with brown adipocytes, 6,7 which breaks down lipids to generate heat – thus reducing obesity. Here, we provide a brief overview of the basics and recent progress in muscle-fat crosstalk in the context of body energy metabolism, obesity, and diabetes. We summarize the different types of adipocytes, their developmental origins and implications in body composition. We highlight the role of several novel myokines in regulating fat mass and systemic energy balance, and evaluate the potential of skeletal muscles as a therapeutic target to treat obesity. © 2014 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irisin, a newly discovered myokine, can drive the browning of white adipocytes to control body weight or mitigate obesity progression through regulating energy metabolism. However, the underlying mechanisms or specific signal pathways of exercise-induced irisin on the management of obesity are still unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Totally 30 rats were subjected to high fat diet (HFD) feeding for 8 weeks to establish the rat model with obesity successfully. HFD-induced obese model rats were provided with 8 weeks swimming intervention at moderate intensity for exploring the treatment of obesity through exercise intervention. In addition, another 15 rats were subjected to HFD feeding coupled with total 16 weeks swimming intervention at a moderate intensity from the beginning of the experiment, which was used for exploring the prevention of obesity through exercise intervention. Blood and gastrocnemius samples were harvested from obese rats after swimming intervention to explore its specific signal pathways through ELISA analysis and Western blotting. RESULTS: HFD feeding of rats for 8 weeks could lead to the obesity due to the disorders of lipid metabolism. Totally 8 weeks swimming intervention at moderate intensity for rats with obesity could obviously alleviate the progression of obesity and 16 weeks swimming intervention from the beginning of the experiment could significantly inhibit the development of obesity. Meanwhile, swimming intervention could result in an increased phosphorylation of AMPK and up-regulation of irisin and PGC-1α?as the biomarkers of energy metabolism. CONCLUSION: Exercise intervention can activate PGC-1α-dependent irisin to induce the browning of white adipocytes, thus inhibiting or alleviating the occurrence and development of obesity.},

  abstract = {Aim. Myokines and angiogenesis factors, studies on trainings according to the difference of exercise intensity are not sufficient, and it has not been elucidated. Particularly, studies on the effect of resistance exercise according to the intensity of resistance exercise on blood myokines and angiogenesis may be essential in the metabolic process of angiogenesis and the formation of muscle. Methods. The subjects of our studies were healthy male college students (N.=30) randomly assigned to the high intensity exercise group (N.=10), the moderate intensity exercise group (N.=10), and the control group (N.=10). The study was performed after obtaining a consent in advance, and the approval from the Institutional Review Board of Dong-A University Hospital. In the body composition test, height, weight, BMI (body mass index), \%fat, and LBM (lean body mass) were measured by electric impedance. In blood analysis, myokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-15) and angiogenesis factors (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin (Ang)l, follistatin (FLRG)) were analyzed by ELISA methods. Results. The results show \%body fat and LBM of the three groups were significantly different (P{$<$}0.05). IL-6 and IL-8 of the three groups were significantly different (P{$<$}0.05). Particularly, IL-8 of RE60 (60\% of IRM) was shown to be significantly higher than other groups (P{$<$}0.05). IL-15 also showed significant differences with time (P{$<$}0.05). In addition, VEGF and Ang 1 showed significant differences with time (P{$<$}0.05), nonetheless, FLRG did not showed statistical differences. Conclusion. Many of muscle contraction through 8 weeks resistance exercise exerted positive effects on the concentration of blood myokines as well as angiogenesis. Particularly, in regard to blood myokines, moderate intensity exercise were more effective than high intensity exercise, which is considered to be due to that continuous muscle contraction of mod érate intensity exercises exerted more positive effects on the elevation of the concentraction of myokines than less muscle contraction of high intensity exercise.},

  abstract = {Chronic, systemic inflammation is an independent risk factor for several major clinical diseases. In obesity, circulating levels of inflammatory markers are elevated, possibly due to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from several tissues/cells, including macrophages within adipose tissue, vascular endothelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recent evidence supports that adipose tissue hypoxia may be an important mechanism through which enlarged adipose tissue elicits local tissue inflammation and further contributes to systemic inflammation. Current evidence supports that exercise training, such as aerobic and resistance exercise, reduces chronic inflammation, especially in obese individuals with high levels of inflammatory biomarkers undergoing a longer-term intervention. Several studies have reported that this effect is independent of the exercise-induced weight loss. There are several mechanisms through which exercise training reduces chronic inflammation, including its effect on muscle tissue to generate muscle-derived, anti-inflammatory 'myokine', its effect on adipose tissue to improve hypoxia and reduce local adipose tissue inflammation, its effect on endothelial cells to reduce leukocyte adhesion and cytokine production systemically, and its effect on the immune system to lower the number of pro-inflammatory cells and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production per cell. Of these potential mechanisms, the effect of exercise training on adipose tissue oxygenation is worth further investigation, as it is very likely that exercise training stimulates adipose tissue angiogenesis and increases blood flow, thereby reducing hypoxia and the associated chronic inflammation in adipose tissue of obese individuals. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.}

  abstract = {Irisin is a peptide secreted by skeletal muscle following exercise that plays an important role in bone metabolism. Numerous experiments in vitro and in mouse models have shown that the administration of recombinant irisin promotes osteogenesis, protects osteocytes from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, prevents disuse-induced loss of bone and muscle mass, and accelerates fracture healing. Although some aspects still need to be elucidated, such as the dose-and frequency-dependent effects of irisin in cell cultures and mouse models, ample clinical evidence is emerging to support its physiological relevance on bone in humans. A reduction in serum irisin levels, associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures, was observed in postmenopausal women and in both men and women during aging, Recently, cohort studies of subjects with secondary osteoporosis showed that these patients have lower circulating levels of irisin, suggesting that this myokine could be a novel marker to monitor bone quality in this disease. Although there are still few studies, this review discusses the emerging data that are highlighting the involvement of irisin in some diseases that cause secondary osteoporosis. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract = {This report presents the Harespod dataset, an open dataset for high altitude hypoxia research, which includes respiration and SpO2 data. The dataset was collected from 15 college students aged 23–31 in a hypobaric oxygen chamber, during simulated altitude changes and induced hypoxia. Real-time physiological data, such as oxygen saturation waveforms, oxygen saturation, respiratory waveforms, heart rate, and pulse rate, were obtained at 100\,Hz. Approximately 12\,hours of valid data were collected from all participants. Researchers can easily identify the altitude corresponding to physiological signals based on their inherent patterns. Time markers were also recorded during altitude changes to facilitate realistic annotation of physiological signals and analysis of time-difference-of-arrival between various physiological signals for the same altitude change event. In high altitude scenarios, this dataset can be used to enhance the detection of human hypoxia states, predict respiratory waveforms, and develop related hardware devices. It will serve as a valuable and standardized resource for researchers in the field of high altitude hypoxia research, enabling comprehensive analysis and comparison.},

  abstract = {As the largest tissue in the body, skeletal muscle not only plays key roles in movement and glucose uptake and utilization but also mediates insulin sensitivity in the body by myokines. Insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle is a major feature of type 2 diabetes (T2D). A weakened response to insulin could lead to muscle mass loss and dysfunction. Increasing evidence in skeletal muscle cells, rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans has shown that restriction of caloric or protein intake positively mediates insulin sensitivity. Restriction of essential or nonessential amino acids was reported to facilitate glucose utilization and regulate protein turnover in skeletal muscle under certain conditions. Furthermore, some minerals, such as zinc, chromium, vitamins, and some natural phytochemicals such as curcumin, resveratrol, berberine, astragalus polysaccharide, emodin, and genistein, have been shown recently to protect skeletal muscle cells, mice, or humans with or without diabetes from insulin resistance. In this review, we discuss the roles of nutritional interventions in the regulation of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. A comprehensive understanding of the nutritional regulation of insulin signaling would contribute to the development of tools and treatment programs for improving skeletal muscle health and for preventing T2D. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

  abstract = {Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine expressed as a bioactive peptide in multiple tissues and organs, and exercise and cold exposure are the major inducers for its secretion. Irisin presents a decreasing trend with the extension of age and is also closely associated with a wide range of aging-related diseases. Currently, many studies on irisin are being conducted with respect to physiological functions for health promotion, and the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of chronic diseases, as well as mechanisms associated with improving energy metabolic balance, enhancing cellular homeostasis by optimizing autophagy, promoting mitochondrial quality control, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitigating inflammatory responses. These diseases include: metabolic diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes, and bone metabolism); cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy and stroke); nervous system diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke); and others (cancer and sarcopenia). Although the current studies on irisin are relatively extensive, some studies have produced unexplained experimental results. This article introduces an overview of the generation, secretion, and tissue distribution, of irisin, and its targeting of tissues or organs for the prevention and treatment of above-mentioned chronic diseases is systematically summarized, with discussion of the underlying molecular mechanisms. This study is expected to improve the understanding of irisin, which may be beneficial to identify novel and effective targets for the screening, diagnosis, or therapy of these chronic diseases, or develop promising interventional strategies, effective drug candidates, functional foods, or exercise mimetics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Sarcopenia and osteoporosis are common musculoskeletal comorbidities of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that seriously affect the quality of life and prognosis of the patient. In addition to spatially mechanical interactions, muscle and bone can also serve as endocrine organs by producing myokines and osteokines to regulate muscle and bone functions, respectively. As positive and negative regulators of skeletal muscles, the myokines irisin and myostatin not only promote/inhibit the differentiation and growth of skeletal muscles, but also regulate bone metabolism. Both irisin and myostatin have been shown to be dysregulated and associated with exercise and skeletal muscle dysfunction in COPD. During exercise, skeletal muscles produce a large amount of IL-6 which acts as a myokine, exerting at least two different conflicting functions depending on physiological or pathological conditions. Remarkably, IL-6 is highly expressed in COPD, and considered to be a biomarker of systemic inflammation, which is associated with both sarcopenia and bone loss. For osteokines, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), a classical regulator of bone metabolism, was recently found to play a critical role in skeletal muscle atrophy induced by chronic cigarette smoke (CS) exposure. In this focused review, we described evidence for myokines and osteokines in the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle dysfunction/sarcopenia and osteoporosis in COPD, and proposed muscle-bone crosstalk as an important mechanism underlying the coexistence of muscle and bone diseases in COPD. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang and Sun.},

  abstract = {Objective: To analyze the research hot spots and frontiers of molecular mechanisms of exercise on cancer via CiteSpace. Method: Related publications in the Web of Science Core Collection Science Citation Index Expanded were retrieved from inception to November 27th, 2021. Then we used CiteSpace to generate network maps and identify top authors, institutions, countries, keywords, co-cited authors, journals, references and research trends. Results: A total of 1,130 related publications were retrieved. The most productive author and journal were Lee W Jones and PLOS ONE. Hanahan D and Warburg O were the most cited authors. Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University were the leading institutions, while China was the leading country. Top-cited authors and references generally focused on the epidemiology and hallmarks of cancer. Top five keywords with both high frequency and high betweenness centrality were breast cancer, aerobic glycolysis, oxidative stress, gene expression, skeletal muscle. Keyword “warburg effect” ranked first with the highest citation burst, while “inflammation”, “hepatocellular carcinoma”, “epithelial mesenchymal transition”, and “adipose tissue” were emerging research foci. Conclusion: This study analyzed the research hot spots and frontiers of molecular mechanisms of exercise on cancer via CiteSpace. Based on the results, altered metabolism (aerobic glycolysis, insulin resistance, myokines), oxidative stress, gene expression and apoptosis were hot-research mechanisms of exercise on cancer. Emerging research foci of mechanisms were generally around inflammation, epithelial mesenchymal transition and adipokines. In addition, future studies could carry in-depth research of interactions between different mechanisms and try to elucidate the recommended doses and intensities of exercise for cancer, especially in breast, colorectal, prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.

  abstract = {Modifiable lifestyle factors are the strongest determinants and major preventable causes of most type of cancer. Exercise has shown many beneficial effects in cancer prevention and anticancer treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To contribute to our understanding of the role of exercise regulation in cancer and provide recommendations for future preclinical and clinical exercise oncology research, we examine the functions of exercise in cancer and its underlying mechanisms. In addition to reducing the incidence of cancer, exercise can enhance the efficacy of certain types of approved anticancer treatments (e.g., targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy) and reduce the symptoms/side effects of cancer and its treatment (e.g., fatigue, cancer cachexia, cognitive impairment, and depression). The mechanisms mediating these effects include the regulation of intratumoral angiogenesis, myokines, adipokines and their associated pathways, cancer metabolism, and anticancer immunity. Cancer rehabilitation guidelines advise cancer survivors to perform exercises. Many ongoing clinical trials have investigated the effects and mechanisms of exercise in cancer. This review supports the prescription of exercise for cancer prevention to sensitize cancer to anticancer therapy and manage associated symptoms and side effects after cancer diagnosis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Acute high-altitude illnesses are of great concern for physicians and people traveling to high altitude. Our recent article “Acute Mountain Sickness, High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema and High-Altitude Cerebral Edema, a View from the High Andes” was questioned by some sea-level high-altitude experts. As a result of this, we answer some observations and further explain our opinion on these diseases. High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) can be better understood through the Oxygen Transport Triad, which involves the pneumo-dynamic pump (ventilation), the hemo-dynamic pump (heart and circulation), and hemoglobin. The two pumps are the first physiologic response upon initial exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. Hemoglobin is the balancing energy-saving time-evolving equilibrating factor. The acid-base balance must be adequately interpreted using the high-altitude Van Slyke correction factors. Pulse-oximetry measurements during breath-holding at high altitude allow for the evaluation of high altitude diseases. The Tolerance to Hypoxia Formula shows that, paradoxically, the higher the altitude, the more tolerance to hypoxia. In order to survive, all organisms adapt physiologically and optimally to the high-altitude environment, and there cannot be any “loss of adaptation”. A favorable evolution in HAPE and pulmonary hypertension can result from the oxygen treatment along with other measures.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, the muscular system has gained attention due to the discovery of the muscle-secretome and its high potency for retaining or regaining health. These cytokines, described as myokines, released by the working muscle, are involved in anti-inflammatory, metabolic and immunological processes. These are able to influence human health in a positive way and are a target of research in metabolic diseases, cancer, neurological diseases, and other non-communicable diseases. Therefore, different types of exercise training were investigated in the last few years to find associations between exercise, myokines and their effects on human health. Particularly, resistance training turned out to be a powerful stimulus to enhance myokine release. As there are different types of resistance training, different myokines are stimulated, depending on the mode of training. This narrative review gives an overview about resistance training and how it can be utilized to stimulate myokine production in order to gain a certain health effect. Finally, the question of why resistance training is an important key regulator in human health will be discussed. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},
