  abstract = {Background New Zealand children's health and fitness performance is declining over time, but whether this change is because of deterioration in all children's health and fitness performance or can be attributed to just a certain portion of the population, is unknown. Objectives In this study, secular trends and distributional changes in health-related and performance-related fitness components among New Zealand primary school children aged 10 to 14 years between 1991 and 2003 were tracked. Methods Health- and performance-related fitness parameters including height, weight, body mass index (BMI), flexibility, standing broad jump, 4{\texttimes}9-m agility run, abdominal curl-ups, and 550-m run were collected up to twice a year from 3306 children (10--14 years old) from a New Zealand school between 1991 and 2003. Results Over the 12-year period, the boys' weight increased by 4.5 kg (95\% CL 2.7 to 6.2, or 0.8\% per year) and girls' by 3.9 kg (95\% CL 2.0 to 5.9, or 0.7\% per year). Mean BMI increased by 0.12 kg m-2 (0.6\%) and 0.11 kg m-2 (0.5\%) per year for boys and girls, respectively. Children's 550-m run performance declined by 1.5\% and 1.7\% per year for boys and girls, respectively. Little difference existed between children located in the highest performing and leanest percentiles in 1991 and 2003, but for children in the poorest performing and fattest percentiles, their results were substantially worse in 2003. Conclusions These results suggest that the deterioration in the health-related and performance-related fitness components of New Zealand 10--14-year-olds is not homogeneous but skewed towards those children who are the heaviest and perform worst in fitness tests. Previous research on health-related fitness parameters among children in New Zealand is limited but shows secular trends of increasing body mass1 2 in conjunction with deteriorating aerobic fitness performance, muscular endurance and explosive muscular power.3 Internationally, similar increases in body mass have been observed in children since the 1980s.1 4 5 Secular trends of deteriorating health-related fitness performance have also been reported among children around the world,1 5 6 with the most significant decreases observed in aerobic performance. However, trends in health-related variables reported as changes in mean body mass index (BMI) and mean aerobic fitness performance do not reveal possible changes in the distribution of BMI or aerobic performance within the population. Changes in such measures may come about because of a shift in the entire population under investigation or a change in a portion of the population. It is not clear whether New Zealand's entire childhood population is becoming heavier and less aerobically fit or whether only a portion of the children are becoming even heavier and more unfit, with the remaining children showing little secular change. The aim of this study was to track secular trends and distributional changes in body weight and physical fitness parameters among New Zealand primary school children aged 10 to 14 years.},

  abstract = {Vertical jump performance tests can give considerably different results, even when different methods are used to analyze the same jump trial from the same subject. To evaluate and compare 4 different methods commonly used to measure vertical jump performance, 52 physically active men each performed 5 maximal vertical jumps. Kinetic and kinematic data were used to analyze each trial using the 4 methods: a criterion test based on body center of mass displacement (VJPT), 2 methods based on vertical takeoff velocity as calculated from the force platform, and 1 method based on time in the air (JUMPAIR). All 4 methods showed excellent reliability (R {$>$} .97). Using VJPT as the criterion, the other 3 methods showed excellent coefficients of validity (R {$>$} .95) but poor accuracy: The obtained vertical jump height scores were statistically different among all methods (p {$<$} .01). JUMPAIR is considered a relatively simple and inexpensive method to obtain valid and reliable measures of vertical jump performance without an arm swing, provided the appropriate adjustments are made to the jump results.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the acute effects of different modes of stretching on vertical jump performance. Eighteen male university students (age, 24.3 {\textpm} 3.2 years; height, 181.5 {\textpm} 11.4 cm; body mass, 78.1 {\textpm} 6.4 kg; mean {\textpm} SD) completed 4 different conditions in a randomized order, on different days, interspersed by a minimum of 72 hours of rest. Each session consisted of a standard 5-minute cycle warm-up, accompanied by one of the subsequent conditions: (a) control, (b) 10-minute static stretching, (c) 10-minute ballistic stretching, or (d) 10-minute proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching. The subjects performed 3 trials of static and countermovement jumps prior to stretching and poststretching at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. Vertical jump height decreased after static and PNF stretching (4.0\% and 5.1\%, p {$<$} 0.05) and there was a smaller decrease after ballistic stretching (2.7\%, p {$>$} 0.05). However, jumping performance had fully recovered 15 minutes after all stretching conditions. In conclusion, vertical jump performance is diminished for 15 minutes if performed after static or PNF stretching, whereas ballistic stretching has little effect on jumping performance. Consequently, PNF or static stretching should not be performed immediately prior to an explosive athletic movement.},

J Strength Cond Res 26(9): 2447--2452, 2012---The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of 3 different stretching methods combined with a warm-up protocol on vertical jump performance. Sixteen young tennis players (14.5 {\textpm} 2.8 years; 175 {\textpm} 5.6 cm; 64.0 {\textpm} 11.1 kg) were randomly assigned to 4 different experimental conditions on 4 successive days. Each session consisted of a general and specific warm-up, with 5 minutes of running followed by 10 jumps, accompanied by one of the subsequent conditions: (a) Control Condition (CC)---5 minutes of passive rest; (b) Passive Stretching Condition (PSC)---5 minutes of passive static stretching; (c) Active Stretching Condition (ASC)---5 minutes of active static stretching; and (d) Dynamic Stretching Condition (DC)---5 minutes of dynamic stretching. After each intervention, the subjects performed 3 squat jumps (SJs) and 3 countermovement jumps (CMJs), which were measured electronically. For the SJ, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance (CC {\texttimes} PSC {\texttimes} ASC {\texttimes} DC) revealed significant decreases for ASC (28.7 {\textpm} 4.7 cm; p = 0.01) and PSC (28.7 {\textpm} 4.3 cm; p = 0.02) conditions when compared with CC (29.9 {\textpm} 5.0 cm). For CMJs, there were no significant decreases (p {$>$} 0.05) when all stretching conditions were compared with the CC. Significant increases in SJ performance were observed when comparing the DC (29.6 {\textpm} 4.9 cm; p = 0.02) with PSC (28.7 {\textpm} 4.3 cm). Significant increases in CMJ performance were observed when comparing the conditions ASC (34.0 {\textpm} 6.0 cm; p = 0.04) and DC (33.7 {\textpm} 5.5 cm; p = 0.03) with PSC (32.6 {\textpm} 5.5 cm).

The VJ flight times assessed using an optical mat (Optojump) and an accelerometer-based (Myotest) system were compared with that of a force platform. The flight times recorded during a countermovement jump (CMJ) were collected from 20 rugby players (n = 86 jumps) concurrently using the 3 tracking systems. Significant bias between the Force platform and either the Optojump (bias = 0.006 {\textpm} 0.007; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.004--0.007 seconds) and Myotest (bias = -0.031 {\textpm} 0.021; 95\% CI 0.035 to -0.026s; p {$<$} 0.0001) occurred. A nearly perfect correlation was found between force platform and Optojump (r = 0.99; 95\% CI 0.098--0.99; p {$<$} 0.0001). Force platform and Myotest (r = 0.89; 95\% CI 0.084--0.93; p {$<$} 0.0001) flight times showed very large association. Difference between Optojump and Myotest systems was significant (-0.036 {\textpm} 0.021 seconds; 95\% CI -0.041 to -0.032; p {$<$} 0.0001), which results in Myotest mean flight time being approximately 7.2\% longer than the Optojump flight time. The association between Optojump and Myotest was nearly perfect (r = 0.91, 95\% CI 0.86--0.94; p {$<$} 0.0001). This study showed that the Optojump and Myotest systems possess convergent validity and can be successfully used under field conditions to assess VJ while performing a CMJ. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting data obtained from different portable systems for field measurement.},

Participating nations in the southern hemisphere include Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Samoa, with only the British Isles (England, Scotland, and Wales), Ireland, and France representing the Northern Hemisphere. Currently, little data exists regarding the physical demands of professional rugby league, with evidence being solely represented through sub-elite10 and junior players.18 This knowledge however, is fundamental when designing strength and conditioning programmes and specific to this article, fitness testing batteries. Therefore, the purpose of this article is two fold. Firstly, to conduct a needs analysis of rugby league and thus identify the fundamental fitness parameters. Then secondly, compare and contrast tests deemed suitable to assess these and from which a testing battery will be advised. The fitness testing battery will also be considered based on the practical experience gained from working with professional rugby league teams. This is an important step in bridging the gap between the theory and application of sport science, whereby the constraints of the work place can also be commented on.},

  abstract = {Sudden cardiac arrest is most often the first clinical manifestation of an underlying cardiovascular disease and usually occurs in previously asymptomatic athletes. The risk benefit ratio of physical exercise differs between young competitive athletes and middle-age/senior individuals engaged in leisure-time sports activity. Competitive sports are associated with an increase in the risk of sudden cardiovascular death (SCD) in susceptible adolescents and young adults with underlying cardiovascular disorders. In middle-age/older individuals, physical activity can be regarded as a `two-edged sword': vigorous exertion increases the incidence of acute coronary events in those who did not exercise regularly, whereas habitual physical activity reduces the overall risk of myocardial infarction and SCD. Although cardiovascular pre-participation evaluation offers the potential to identify athletes with life-threatening cardiovascular abnormalities before onset of symptoms and may reduce their risk of SCD, there is a significant debate among cardiologists about efficacy, impact of false-positive results and cost-effectiveness of routine screening. This review presents an appraisal of the available data and criticisms concerning screening programmes aimed to prevent SCD of either young competitive athletes or older individuals engaged in leisure-time sports activity},

The order of the stretching protocols was randomized for each subject. During each testing session, all subjects performed a 5-minute light jog as a warm-up, followed by 8 minutes of 1 of the stretching protocols. One minute after the completion of each protocol, 5 maximal CMJ were performed on a force platform, with each jump separated by 1 minute of passive recovery. Jump heights were calculated by integrating the vertical force trace. There were no significant differences between the SS, DS, and NS conditions for any of the jumps (p {$>$} 0.05). Despite the lack of significant effects for the group, there were notable individual responses to each of the warm-up conditions. Practitioners should be aware of the individual responses of their athletes to different types of warm-up protocols before athletic performance and the possible impact of prescribing or eliminating certain exercises.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Police officers require a certain amount of occupational fitness to successfully perform physically demanding tasks. As such, trainees are required to undergo training to develop their ability to perform such tasks. The physical competency test (PCT) is a 400 m obstacle course consisting of key police occupational physical tasks used to evaluate a trainee's ability to complete tasks that a police officer is expected to perform whilst on duty. The purpose of this study was to profile the PCT in a police recruit population to provide an indication of the current level of occupational fitness within a policing population to inform conditioning requirements. Retrospective data for 813 male (age = 27.41 {\textpm} 5.92 years, body mass = 83.98 {\textpm} 14.03 kg, height = 179.23 {\textpm} 10.50 cm, BMI = 25.85 {\textpm} 3.92 kg/m2) and 372 female (mean age = 27.01 {\textpm} 6.45 years, mean weight = 67.14 {\textpm} 8.60 kg, mean height = 168.14 {\textpm} 6.46 cm and mean BMI = 23.61 {\textpm} 2.52 kg/m2) police trainees from the New Zealand Police Constabulary Recruitment database were provided for analysis. Anthropometric data, including height, body mass, and BMI were provided, in addition to trainee PCT time. Data were split by sex and age. Significant differences were observed between sexes for all anthropometric measures and PCT time ({$<$}italic{$>$}p{$<$}/italic{$>$} \&lt; 0.001). Generally, in both the male and female groups, younger recruits tended to perform better than the older recruits with results between the ``under 20'' and the 20--24-year-old-age groups performing significantly better than the 35--39-year-old-age group in both sexes, and the 25--29-year-old-age group performing significantly better than the 35--39-year-old-age group in female officers. The data provided in this study provides a profile for performance of male and female recruits of various ages on the PCT in preparation for entry, or re-entry following injury, into the NZ Police. However, given that the PCT is considered a measure of occupational task performance, consideration should be given to the use of sex and age neutral requirements as the occupational tasks performed by police officers exhibit the same traits regardless of sex or age. Older trainees may therefore need conditioning to improve PCT times and subsequently occupational performance.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

J Strength Cond Res 23(2): 507-512, 2009-The results of previous research have demonstrated that static stretching (SS) can reduce muscular performance and that dynamic stretching (DS) can enhance muscular performance. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of SS and DS on vertical jump (VJ) performance and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the m. vastus medialis. Eleven healthy men (age 21 {\textpm} 2 years) took part in 3 conditions (no stretching [NS], SS, and DS), on separate occasions in a randomized, crossover design. During each condition, measurements of VJ height and EMG activity during the VJ were recorded. A repeated-measures analysis of variance and post hoc analysis indicated that VJ height was significantly less (4.19 {\textpm} 4.47\%) after SS than NS (p {$<$} 0.05) and significantly greater (9.44 {\textpm} 4.25\%) in DS than SS (p {$<$} 0.05). There was significantly greater EMG amplitude in the DS compared with the SS (p {$<$} 0.05). The results demonstrated that SS has a negative influence on VJ performance, whereas DS has a positive impact. Increased VJ performance after DS may be attributed to postactivation potentiation, whereas the reduction in VJ performance after SS may be attributable to neurological impairment and a possible alteration in the viscoelastic properties of the muscular tendon unit (MTU). This investigation provides some physiological basis for the inclusion of DS and exclusion of SS in preparation for activities requiring jumping performance.},

J Strength Cond Res 22(6): 1844-1849, 2008- Stretching before performance is a common practice among athletes in hopes of increasing performance and reducing the risk of injury. However, cumulative results indicate a negative impact of static stretching and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on performance; thus, there is a need for evaluating other stretching strategies for effective warm-up. The purpose of this study was to compare the differences between two sets of ballistic stretching and two sets of a dynamic stretching routine on vertical jump performance. Twenty healthy male and female college students between the ages of 22 and 34 (24.8 {\textpm} 3 years) volunteered to participate in this study. All subjects completed three individual testing sessions on three nonconsecutive days. On each day, the subjects completed one of three treatments (no stretch, ballistic stretch, and dynamic stretch). Intraclass reliability was determined using the data obtained from each subject. A paired samples t-test revealed no significant difference in jump height, force, or power when comparing no stretch with ballistic stretch. A significant difference was found on jump power when comparing no stretch with dynamic stretch, but no significant difference was found for jump height or force. Statistics showed a very high reliability when measuring jump height, force, and power using the Kistler Quattro Jump force plate. It seems that neither dynamic stretching nor ballistic stretching will result in an increase in vertical jump height or force. However, dynamic stretching elicited gains in jump power poststretch.},

J Strength Cond Res 28(5): 1263--1271, 2014---The aim of this study was to evaluate 3 different flexibility techniques: (a) ballistic stretching (BS), (b) proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching (PNF) + BS, and (c) PNF + static stretching (SS) on vertical jump (VJ) performance and to determine the most appropriate stretching method during warm-up period before explosive force disciplines. One hundred voluntary male athletes participated in this study. All subjects performed aerobic warm-up (5-minute jog) followed by BS (5 seconds for each stretching exercise), PNF + BS (PNF performed followed by 5 seconds of BS), and PNF + SS (PNF performed followed by 30 seconds of SS) treatment protocol, respectively in the same day. Each stretching treatment was applied for 4 sets bilaterally. In all stretching treatments, lumbar extensor, gluteus maximus, and hamstring muscles were stretched with a single stretching exercise. After a 2-minute brief rest period, participants performed 3 trials of VJ test followed by one of the treatment protocols. Vertical jump performance was evaluated by countermovement jump (CMJ). Participants were divided into 3 groups according to their flexibility and prejump performances after warm-up. For each individual group and the whole group, after all treatments, differences in CMJ values were obtained (p {$\leq$} 0.05). Ballistic stretching increased the VJ performance in the groups with low and average flexibility, poor prejumping performance, and also in the whole group (p {$\leq$} 0.05). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching + BS affected VJ performance in the group of participants with high flexibility (p {$\leq$} 0.05). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation + SS decreased VJ performance in groups of participants with high flexibility, moderate, and high prejumping performance and in whole group (p {$\leq$} 0.05). Ballistic stretching method increased VJ height, therefore seems to be more suitable than PNF + SS and PNF + BS before events that rely on explosive power as a part of warm-up period.},

Sagittal plane videography (60 Hz) was used to measure the kinematics of vertical jumps after 2 warm-up routines, control and stretching. Subjects were tested on 2 occasions with warm-up routine randomized. There were no significant changes in vertical velocity knee angle, or the durations of the eccentric and concentric phases as a result of stretching despite good statistical power for the tests. Fifty-five percent of the subjects had lower vertical velocities (-7.5\%) after stretching, while 45 percent of the subjects had no change (10\%) or higher vertical (35\%) velocities (2.4\%) after stretching. Stretching prior to stretch-shortening cycle activities like the vertical jump results in small decreases in performance in some subjects, but the nonsignificant biomechanical changes suggest that neuromuscular inhibition may be the mechanism rather than changes in muscle stiffness.},

  abstract = {There are several methods used in sports science to identify asymmetries in athletes, given their purported relevance to injury prevention and performance optimization. We aimed to verify whether asymmetries provided by isokinetic assessments, jump tests, and tensiomyography (TMG) are associated with each other, and whether their respective functional indices are related to jumping ability. TMG parameters, unilateral and bilateral squat-jump (SJ) and countermovement-jump (CMJ) performances, and peak torque in knee-extension and flexion with angular velocities of 60o/s and 300o/s for twenty-four soccer players were retained for analyses. Asymmetry was detected by examining the percentage difference between dominant and non-dominant legs. The median-split technique was used to identify the best and worst performers in SJ and CMJ tests. Results revealed that the asymmetries detected in the three different methods were not interrelated. Curiously, better performances in SJ and CMJ tests were associated with higher asymmetry levels. Furthermore, only the knee-extension peak torque at both angular velocities was correlated moderately to largely (r=0.48-0.66) with jump performance. Despite their recognized ability to predict the risk of injury, the absence of interrelationships between TMG, isokinetic tests, and unilateral jumps precludes their single use as a unique functional screening diagnostic. Finally, and very importantly, lower-limb asymmetry is not necessarily related to impaired vertical jump performance in soccer players.},

Methods Eighteen sportsmen performed unilateral jump assessments involving the horizontal squat jump, horizontal countermovement jump, horizontal repetitive jump, vertical squat jump, vertical countermovement jump, and vertical repetitive jump. Results Reliability for the new test was found to be the equal if not better than the other more established tests of leg power, with the within trial variation (CV=1.1--1.9\%) and test--retest reliability (ICC=0.89--0.90). None of the tests were found to have greater discriminative ability in determining limb asymmetries. Stretch shorten cycle enhancement was greater in the vertical tests (12.1\%) compared to the horizontal tests (1.3\%). Horizontal jump assessments (r=-0.73 to -0.86) were found better predictors of 20-m sprint performance than the vertical assessments (r=-0.52 to -0.73), with the horizontal cyclic assessment being the best predictor (r=-0.86). Conclusion Horizontal leg power assessment appears an inexpensive, easy to administer, reliable and valid method to assess unilateral leg power.},

Performance of squat, countermovement, and drop jumps with different dropping heights was assessed on the Jump-and-Reach Test and the measurement of flight time, then compared across different jump trials. The very high reliability coefficients of both assessment methods and the lower correlation coefficients between scores on the assessments indicate a very high consistency of each method but only moderate covariation, which means that they measure partly different items. As a consequence, the Jump-and-Reach Test has good ecological validity in situations when reaching height during the flight phase is critical for performance (e.g., basketball and volleyball) but only limited accuracy for the assessment of vertical impulse production with different jump techniques and conditions.},

Measured variables include jump height and duration along with absolute and relative peak muscular power. Several investigators have clearly shown superior jump performance variables in elite athletes as compared to non-elite subjects.

  abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that stretching routines can induce strength and force deficits, although the amount of stretching needed to cause these deficits remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between varying amounts of acute static stretching on jumping performance. By systematically increasing the amount of stretching, possible differences in jump height may be discovered, defining a line where acute static stretching becomes detrimental to performance. Ten collegiate athletes and 10 recreational athletes completed 3 different stretching treatments and 1 control treatment on different days in a within-treatment design. Stretching treatments consisted of 2, 4, or 6 sets of stretches, with each stretch held for 15 seconds with a 15-second rest. Stretches were done to the quadriceps, hamstrings, and plantar flexors. Upon arrival, each subject performed a 5-minute warm-up on a stationary upright cycle. After a brief rest period, participants performed 3 trials of a vertical jump test, followed by one of the treatment protocols. After another rest period, a second set of vertical jump trials was performed. Post-6 sets was significantly lower than Pre-6 sets (p {$\leq$} 0.05). Additionally, Post-6 sets was significantly lower than Pre-4 sets, Pre-2 sets, and Pre-control (p {$\leq$} 0.05). No other conditions were significantly different. In conclusion, 6 sets of stretches, or 90 seconds per muscle group, should not be performed before power activities such as jumping where optimal performance is desired.},

The authors reviewed physical fitness and health in youth findings from cross-sectional studies. The authors also performed three systematic reviews dealing with (1) the predictive validity of health-related fitness, (2) the criterion validity of field-based fitness tests and (3) the reliability of field-based fitness tests in youth. The authors also carried out 11-methodological studies to determine the criterion validity and the reliability of several field-based fitness tests for youth. Finally, the authors performed a study in the school setting to examine the reliability, feasibility and safety of the selected tests. The selected fitness tests were (1) the 20 m shuttle run test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness; (2) the handgrip strength and (3) standing broad jump to assess musculoskeletal fitness, and (4) body mass index, (5) skinfold thickness and (5) waist circumference to assess body composition. When there are time limits, the authors propose the high-priority ALPHA health-related fitness test battery, which comprises all the evidence-based fitness tests except the measurement of the skinfold thickness. The time required to administer this battery to a group of 20 youth by one physical education teacher is less than 2 h. In conclusion, the ALPHA fitness tests battery is valid, reliable, feasible and safe for the assessment of health-related physical fitness in children and adolescents to be used for health monitoring purposes at population level.},

Design: Methodological study. Setting: A health promotion research institute. subjects: In study A, volunteers (n = 42) from two worksites participated. In study B, a population sample (n = 510) of 37- to 57-year-old men and women was selected. Main Outcome Measures: Intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated measures was used to assess inter-rater reliability. The degree of measurement error was expressed as the standard error of measurement. The mean difference with 95\% confidence intervals between the testing days or test trials was used to assess test-retest or trial-to-trial reproducibility. The coefficient of variation (CV = [SD/mean] {\texttimes} 100\%) from day to day was also calculated. Results: The following tests appeared to provide acceptable reliability as methods for field assessment of HRF: standing on one leg with eyes open for balance, side-bending of the trunk for spinal flexibility, modified push-ups for upper body muscular function, and jump and reach and one leg squat for leg muscular function. Conclusions: This reliability assessment provided useful information on the characteristics of potential test items in a HRF test battery for adults and on the limitations of its practical use. Testers must be properly trained to ensure reliable assessment of HRF of adults.},

Health-related fitness refers to those components of fitness that are related to health status. The safety and feasibility of a test battery designed for the assessment of HRFI were evaluated. Subjects and Methods. Middle-aged men (n=246) and women (n=254), evenly selected from five age cohorts of a random sample (N=826), were tested. The subjects had a mean age of 47.0 years (SD=7.9, range=37--57). Screening to identify subjects with health limitations was conducted by fitness testers who had master's degrees in sport or health sciences. Safety was assessed in terms of acute complications, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and heart rate after each test. Subject exclusion and time costs were evaluated for feasibility. Results. No acute complications occurred. The leg function test caused severe DOMS among inactive women. The overall exclusion rate increased with age. Up to 27\% of subjects aged 52 and 57 years were excluded from muscle endurance tests, mainly due to self-reported heart disease or elevated blood pressures. Over 90\% of the subjects, however, qualified for balance, flexibility, muscle force, and walk tests. Conclusion and Discussion. The test battery offers a safe and feasible method for the assessment of HRFI in working-aged adults, with the limitation that the one-leg squat function test may cause DOMS, particularly in inactive women.},

Ten minutes of dynamic stretching is sufficient to potentiate vertical jump performance characteristics. J Strength Cond Res 25(9): 2453-2463, 2011---The current literature recommends dynamic rather than static stretching for the athletic warm-up. Dynamic stretching and various conditioning stimuli are used to induce potentiation in subsequent athletic performance. However, it is unknown as to which type of activity in conjunction with dynamic stretching within a warm-up provides the optimal potentiation of vertical jump performance. It was the objective of the study to examine the possible potentiating effect of various types of conditioning stimuli with dynamic stretching. Twenty athletes participated in 6 protocols. All the experimental protocols included 10 minutes of dynamic stretching. After the dynamic stretching, the subjects performed a (a) concentric (DS/CON): 3 sets of 3 repetition maximum deadlift exercise; (b) isometric (DS/ISOM): 3 sets of 3-second maximum voluntary contraction back squats; (c) plyometric (DS/PLYO): 3 sets of 3 tuck jumps; (d) eccentric (DS/ECC): 3 modified drop jumps; (e) dynamic stretching only (DS), and (f) control protocol (CON). Before the intervention and at recovery periods of 15 seconds, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 minutes, the participants performed 1-2 maximal countermovement jumps. The DS and DS/CON protocols generally had a 95-99\% likelihood of exceeding the smallest worthwhile change for vertical jump height, peak power, velocity and force. However, the addition of the deadlift to the DS did not augment the potentiating effect. Time-to-peak potentiation was variable between individuals but was most consistent between 3 and 5 minutes. Thus, the volume and the intensity associated with 10 minutes of dynamic stretching were sufficient to provide the potentiation of vertical jump characteristics. Additional conditioning activities may promote fatigue processes, which do not permit further potentiation.},

Both the retrospective and prospective receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses identified scores of 96 and 88 as cut-points that provided good discrimination between injured and noninjured cases. The area under the curve was 0.69 (P {$<$} 0.001) for the retrospective analysis and 0.62 (P = 0.016) for the prospective analysis. Cronbach alpha was 0.89 (90\% CI, 0.86-0.91).           Conclusions:~           Self-reported effects of previous injury may be one method to efficiently identify athletes who possess elevated injury risk, and subsequently deliver preventive interventions, thereby providing an alternative method to time-intensive functional testing.},
